==== connectivity project ====
Hallo, my name is Anastasiya Lvova, I'm "duty" in [http://toolserver.org/~lvova/cgi-bin/go.sh?language=sg&interface=en&listby=zns Connectivity project]. The essence of the "Connectivity" project is to study and [http://toolserver.org/~lvova/cgi-bin/go.sh enhance] the coherence of Wikipedia, or, in other words, to improve hypertext navigation between articles. The project deals with deadends, isolated articles, non-categorized articles, transitivity of the category tree, etc.

We want to work with your language version, but we need configured MediaWiki:Disambiguationspage for it (with direct links to template namespace pages, for example, [[:ru:MediaWiki:Disambiguationspage]]/[[:de:MediaWiki:Disambiguationspage]]/[[:fr:MediaWiki:Disambiguationspage]]). Is it possible to set it up for our usage? 

thanks in advance, [[Utilisateur:Lvova|Lvova]] 12 juin 2010 à 18:38 (UTC)
thank you. very much .but l am on duty today.
ok.

==Betawiki: better support for your language in MediaWiki==
Dear community. I am writing to you to promote a special wiki called [[betawiki:|Betawiki]]. This wiki facilitates the localisation (l10n) of the MediaWiki interface. You may have changed many messages here to use your language in the interface, but if you would log in to for example the Japanese language Wiktionary, you would not be able to use the interface as well translated as here. In fact, of 1,736 messages in the core of MediaWiki, 1.59% of the messages have been translated. Betawiki also supports the translation of messages for 126 extensions, with 2,174 messages. Many of them are used in WMF projects and they are vital for understanding the wiki. Currently 0.00% of the WMF extension messages have been translated. Translators for over 90 languages contribute their work to MediaWiki this way every month.

If you wish to contribute to better support of your language in MediaWiki, as well as for many MediaWiki extensions, please visit [[betawiki:Translating:Intro|Betawiki]], [http://translatewiki.net/w/?title=Special:Userlogin&type=signup&uselang=en create an account] and [[betawiki:Betawiki:Rights|request translator privileges]]. You can see the current status of localisation of your language on [[mw:Localisation_statistics|MediaWiki.org]] and do not forget to get in touch with others that may already be [[betawiki:Translating:Languages|working on your language on Betawiki]].

If you have any further questions, [[betawiki:User_talk:Malafaya|please let me know on my talk page on Betawiki]]. We will try and assist you as much as possible, for example by [[betawiki:Import requests|importing]] all messages from a local wiki for you to start with, if you so desire.

You can also find us on the Freenode [[w:en:Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] network in the channel #mediawiki-i18n where we will be happy to help you get started.

Thank you very much for your attention and I do hope to see some of you on [[betawiki:|Betawiki]] soon! Thanks, [[betawiki:User:Malafaya|Malafaya@Betawiki]] 01:52, 5 February 2008 (UTC)

==Bot policy==
Hello. To facilitate [[m:steward|steward]] granting of bot access, I suggest implementing the [[m:Bot policy|standard bot policy]] on this wiki. In particular, this policy allows stewards to automatically flag known interlanguage linking bots (if this page says that is acceptable), which form the vast majority of such requests. The policy also enables [[m:Bot policy#Global_bots|global bots]] on this wiki (if this page says that is acceptable), which are trusted bots that will be given bot access on every wiki that allows global bots.

This policy makes bot access requesting much easier for local users, operators, and stewards. To implement it we only need to create a redirect to this page from [[Project:Bot policy]], and add a line at the top noting that it is used here. Please read the text at [[m:Bot policy]] before commenting. If you object, please say so; I hope to implement in one week if there is no objection, since it is particularly written to streamline bot requests on wikis with little or no community interested in bot access requests. --[[User:Luckas Blade|Luckas Blade]] 15:28, 1 March 2009 (UTC)

: Implemented. —<small>[[m:User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] 02:27:26, 13 March 2009 (UTC)</small>

==The LocalisationUpdate extension has gone live==

The LocalisationUpdate extension is now enabled for all Wikimedia projects. From now on new localisations that become available in SVN will become available to your project within 24 hours. Your localisations get into SVN from [http://translatewiki.net translatewiki.net] typically within a day and at worst in two days. This is a huge improvement from the old practice where the localisations became available with new software. This could take weeks, even months.

The localisations done by our community at translatewiki.net are committed to SVN typically every day. When the system messages in English are the same as the local messages, they will now be inserted in a file and are available for use in all our projects in a timely manner

===What this means for you===
Local messages have an impact on the performance of our system. It is best when messages are as much as possible part of the system messages. In order to remove unnecessary duplication, all the messages that have a local localisation and are '''exactly''' the same as the system message will be removed.  What we ask you to do is to compare and proof read the messages in translatewiki.net and the local messages. You can then either remove local messages when the translatewiki.net message is to be preferred or, you can update the message at translatewiki.net. 

Messages that are specific to your project will have to stay as they are. You do want to check if the format and the variables of the message are still the same.

===Why localise at translatewiki.net===
When you localise at translatewiki.net, your messages will be used in all Wikimedia projects and eventually in all MediaWiki based projects. This is how we provide the standard support for your language. When messages change, at translatewiki.net you will be prompted to revisit your translations. Localising is more efficient because we have innovated the process to make you more efficient; there is text explaining about messages and we have applied AJAX technology to reduce the number of clicks you have to make.

==How can we improve the usability for your language==
We expect that with the implementation of LocalisationUpdate the usability of MediaWiki for your language will improve. We are now ready to look at other aspects of usability for your language as well.  There are two questions we would like you to answer:
Are there issues with the new functionality of the Usability Initiative
Does MediaWiki support your language properly

The best way to answer the first question is to visit the translatewiki.net. Change the language to your language, select the “vector” skin and add the advanced tool bar in in the preferences and check out the new functionality. And make some changes in your user page. When there is a need to improve on the localisation, please make the [http://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translate&group=ext-ui-0-all necessary changes]s . It should update your localisation straight away. 
We would like you to report each issue individually at http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Usability_issues.

When there are problems with the support of MediaWiki for your language, we really want to know about this. It is best to report each issue separately. In this way there will be no large mass of issues to resolve but we can address each issue on its own. Consider issues with the display of characters, the presentation of your script, the position of the side bar, the combination of text with other languages, scripts. It is best to try this in an environment like the prototype wiki as it provides you with a clean, basic and up to date environment. The prototype wiki is available for five languages but you can select any of them, change the preferences to your language and test out MediaWiki for your language.

We would like you to report each issue individually at http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Language_issues. The issues you raise will all be assessed. It is important to keep each issue separate, because this will make it easier to understand the issues and find solutions.

PS you can find the English version of the article '''[[w:en:Lech Wałęsa|here]]'''. Best wishes from Poland, [[Utilisateur:Patrol110|Patrol110]] 3 octobre 2009 à 20:55 (UTC)

==Fundraising time is around the corner!==
Hello Wikimedians, my name is Deniz and I am working for the Wikimedia Foundation during the 2010 Fundraiser. My job is to be the liaison between the Sängö community and the Foundation. This year's fundraiser is intended to be a collaborative and global effort, we recognize that banner messages that perform well in the United States don't necessarily translate well, or appeal to international audiences. <Br>

I'm contacting you as I am currently looking for translators who are willing to contribute to this project, helping to translate and localize messages into Sängö and suggesting messages that would appeal to Sängö readers on the Fundraising Meta Page. We've started the setup on [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010 meta] for both [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010/Messages banner submission], [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010/Banner_testing statistical analysis], and [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010/Committee grouping volunteers together].<br>Use the talk pages on meta, talk to your local communities, talk to others, talk to us, and add your feedback to the proposed messages as well! I look forward to working with you during this year's fundraiser.<br>

Please translate this message into Sängö if you can and post it below.--[[Utilisateur:Dgultekin|Dgultekin]] 10 septembre 2010 à 17:25 (UTC)

===Fundraising 2010: Beat Jimmy Challenge===

The Fundraising Committee is issuing all interested community members a challenge: [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010 we want you to beat Jimmy]. The appeal from Jimmy Wales and the corresponding banner have been tested head-to-head with other successful banners, and the results are clear: it's our best performing message... by a lot. This year we have a lofty fundraising goal; we need all of our banners to bring in donations like the Jimmy Appeal, but no one wants to keep the Jimmy banner up for two months.  We want to run donor quotes, and other wonderful ideas, but we have to have banners that work as well as or better than the Jimmy appeal.

We've just released the highlights from a [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010#Focus_Group donor focus group], and the results of our [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:FR_Donor_survey_report.pdf donor survey]. With one month to the launch of the fundraiser, the messages we test must be driven by data from our tests and surveys - we can no longer rely on instinct alone. 

We've redesigned our fundraising meta pages with the Jimmy challenge; check out the survey results and propose/discuss banners that reflect these findings.  Add the banners you think will 'beat Jimmy' [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Fundraising_2010/Messages/BeatJimmy here] to be tested '''Tuesday October 12''' against Jimmy. -[[Utilisateur:Dgultekin|Dgultekin]] 6 octobre 2010 à 21:57 (UTC)

== Call for image filter referendum ==

The Wikimedia Foundation, at the direction of the Board of Trustees, will be holding a vote to determine whether members of the community support the creation and usage of an opt-in personal image filter, which would allow readers to voluntarily screen particular types of images strictly for their own account.

Further details and educational materials will be available shortly.  The referendum is scheduled for 12-27 August, 2011, and will be conducted on servers hosted by a neutral third party.  Referendum details, officials, voting requirements, and supporting materials will be posted at [[Meta:Image filter referendum]] shortly.

Sorry for delivering you a message in English. Please help translate the pages on the referendum on Meta and join the [[mail:translators-l|translators mailing list]].

== Announcing Wikipedia 1.19 beta ==

Wikimedia Foundation is getting ready to push out 1.19 to all the WMF-hosted wikis.  As we finish wrapping up our code review, you can test the new version ''right now'' on [http://beta.wmflabs.org/ beta.wmflabs.org].  For more information, please read the [https://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/phase3/RELEASE-NOTES-1.19?view=markup release notes] or the [[mw:MediaWiki_1.19|start of the final announcement]].

The following are the areas that you will probably be most interested in:
* [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33711#c2 Faster loading of javascript files makes dependency tracking more important.]
* New common*.css files usable by skins instead of having to copy piles of generic styles from MonoBook or Vector's css.
* The default user signature now contains a talk link in addition to the user link.
* Searching blocked usernames in block log is now clearer.
* Better timezone recognition in user preferences.
* Improved diff readability for colorblind people.
* The interwiki links table can now be accessed also when the interwiki cache is used (used in the API and the Interwiki extension).
* More gender support (for instance in logs and user lists).
* Language converter improved, e.g. it now works depending on the page content language.
* Time and number-formatting magic words also now depend on the page content language.
* Bidirectional support further improved after 1.18.

Report any [http://labs.wikimedia.beta.wmflabs.org/wiki/Problem_reports problems] on the labs beta wiki and we'll work to address them before they software is released to the production wikis.

'''Note''' that this cluster does have SUL but it is not integrated with SUL in production, so you'll need to create another account.  You should avoid using the same password as you use here.  — [[m:Global message delivery|Global message delivery]] 15 Nyenye 2012 à 16:32 (UTC)

==Language support group for Sango==
The Wikimedia Foundation has brought together a new team of developers who are dedicated to language support. This team is to support all the languages and consequently it is not realistic to expect that the team members can provide proper support for your language. It is for this reason that we are looking for volunteers who will make up a [[:translatewiki:language support team|language support team]]. 

This language support team will be asked to provide us with information about their language. Such information may need to be provided either to us or on a website that we will indicate to you. Another activity will be to test software that will likely have an effect on the running of the MediaWiki software. We are looking for people who clearly identify their ability. Formal knowledge is definitely appreciated.

As much of the activity will be concentrated on [[:translatewiki:Main Page|translatewiki.net]], it will be a plus when team members know how to localise at translatewiki.net. <br>

== Update on IPv6 ==

[[File:Wikimedia_Foundation_RGB_logo_with_text.svg|80px|right]]
(Apologies if this message isn't in your language. Please consider translating it, as well as '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/IPv6 initiative/2012 IPv6 Day announcement|the full version of this announcement on Meta]]''') 

The Wikimedia Foundation is planning to do limited testing of IPv6 on June 2-3. If there are not too many problems, we may fully enable IPv6 on [http://www.worldipv6day.org/ World IPv6 day] (June 6), and keep it enabled.

What this means for your project:

*At least on June 2-3, 2012, you may see a small number of edits from IPv6 addresses, which are in the form "<code>2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334</code>". See e.g. [[w:en:IPv6 address]]. These addresses should behave like any other IP address: You can leave messages on their talk pages; you can track their contributions; you can block them. (See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/IPv6 initiative/2012 IPv6 Day announcement|the full version of this announcement]] for notes on range blocks.)

*In the mid term, some user scripts and tools will need to be adapted for IPv6. 

*We suspect that IPv6 usage is going to be very low initially, meaning that abuse should be manageable, and we will assist in the monitoring of the situation.

Read [[m:Special:MyLanguage/IPv6 initiative/2012 IPv6 Day announcement|the full version of this announcement]] on how to test the behavior of IPv6 with various tools and how to leave bug reports, and to find a fuller analysis of the implications of the IPv6 migration.

Dear Wikimedians,

Wikimedia Commons is happy to announce that the ''2011 Picture of the Year competition'' is now open. We are interested in your opinion as to which images qualify to be the ''Picture of the Year 2011''. Any user registered at Commons or a Wikimedia wiki SUL-related to Commons [//toolserver.org/~pathoschild/accounteligibility/?user=&wiki=&event=24 with more than 75 edits before 1 April 2012 (UTC)] is welcome to vote and, of course everyone is welcome to view!

Detailed information about the contest can be found [[:commons:Commons:Picture of the Year/2011/Introduction|at the introductory page]].

About 600 of the best of Wikimedia Common's photos, animations, movies and graphics were chosen &ndash;by the international Wikimedia Commons community&ndash; out of 12 million files during ''2011'' and are now called ''Featured Pictures''.

From professional animal and plant shots to breathtaking panoramas and skylines, restorations of historically relevant images, images portraying the world's best architecture, maps, emblems, diagrams created with the most modern technology, and impressive human portraits, Commons ''Features Pictures'' of all flavors.  

For your convenience, we have sorted the images [[:commons:Commons:Picture of the Year/2011/Galleries|into topic categories]]. 

We regret that you receive this message in English; we intended to use banners to notify you in your native language but there was both, human and technical resistance.

See you on Commons!

[[File:Wikimedia_Foundation_RGB_logo_with_text.svg|80px|right]]
''(Apologies if this message isn't in your language. Please consider translating it)''

Hi,

As many of you are aware, the Wikimedia Board of Trustees recently initiated important changes in the way that money is being distributed within the Wikimedia movement. As part of this, a new community-led "[[m:Funds_Dissemination_Committee/Framework_for_the_Creation_and_Initial_Operation_of_the_FDC|Funds Dissemination Committee]]" (FDC) is currently being set up. Already in 2012-13, its recommendations will guide the decisions about the distribution of over 10 million US dollars among the Foundation, chapters and other [[m:Funds_Dissemination_Committee/Framework_for_the_Creation_and_Initial_Operation_of_the_FDC#Eligible_fund-seeking_entities|eligible entities]].

Now, seven capable, knowledgeable and trustworthy community members are sought to volunteer on the initial Funds Dissemination Committee. It is expected to take up its work in September. In addition, a community member is sought to be the [[m:Funds_Dissemination_Committee/Framework_for_the_Creation_and_Initial_Operation_of_the_FDC#FDC_Ombudsperson|Ombudsperson]] for the FDC process. If you are interested in joining the committee, read the [[m:Funds Dissemination Committee/Call for Volunteers|call for volunteers]]. Nominations are planned to close on August 15.

== More opportunities for you to access free research databases ==

The quest to get editors free access to the sources they need is gaining momentum.
* '''[[w:en:Wikipedia:Credo|Credo Reference]]''' provides full-text online versions of nearly 1200 published reference works from more than 70 publishers in every major subject, including general and subject dictionaries and encyclopedias.  There are '''125''' full Credo 350 accounts available, with access even to 100 more references works than in Credo's original donation.  All you need is a 1-year old account with 1000 edits.  Sign up [[w:en:Wikipedia:Credo#Sign-up sheet|here]].
* '''[[w:en:Wikipedia:HighBeam|HighBeam Research]]''' has access to over 80 million articles from 6,500 publications including newspapers, magazines, academic journals, newswires, trade magazines and encyclopedias.  Thousands of new articles are added daily, and archives date back over 25 years covering a wide range of subjects and industries.  There are '''250''' full access 1-year accounts available.  All you need is a 1-year old account with 1000 edits.  Sign up [[w:en:Wikipedia:HighBeam/Applications|here]].
* '''[[w:en:Wikipedia:Questia|Questia]]'''  is an online research library for books and journal articles focusing on the humanities and social sciences. Questia has curated titles from over 300 trusted publishers including 77,000 full-text books and 4 million journal, magazine, and newspaper articles, as well as encyclopedia entries.  There will soon be '''1000''' full access 1-year accounts available.  All you need is a 1-year old account with 1000 edits.  Sign up [[w:en:Wikipedia:Questia#Apply here: Round 1|here]].

== Wikidata is getting close to a first roll-out ==

[[File:Wikimedia_Foundation_RGB_logo_with_text.svg|80px|right]]
(Apologies if this message isn't in your language.) 

As some of you might already have heard Wikimedia Deutschland is working on a new Wikimedia project. It is called [[m:Wikidata]]. The goal of Wikidata is to become a central data repository for the Wikipedias, its sister projects and the world. In the future it will hold data like the number of inhabitants of a country, the date of birth of a famous person or the length of a river. These can then be used in all Wikimedia projects and outside of them.

The project is divided into three phases and "we are getting close to roll-out the first phase". The phases are:
# language links in the Wikipedias (making it possible to store the links between the language editions of an article just once in Wikidata instead of in each linked article)
# infoboxes (making it possible to store the data that is currently in infoboxes in one central place and share the data)
# lists (making it possible to create lists and similar things based on queries to Wikidata so they update automatically when new data is added or modified)

It'd be great if you could join us, test the [http://wikidata-test.wikimedia.de demo version], provide feedback and take part in the development of Wikidata. You can find all the relevant information including an [[m:Wikidata/FAQ|FAQ]] and sign-up links for our on-wiki newsletter on [[m:Wikidata|the Wikidata page on Meta]]. 

For further discussions please use [[m:Talk:Wikidata|this talk page]] (if you are uncomfortable writing in English you can also write in your native language there) or point [[m:User_talk:Lydia Pintscher (WMDE)|me]] to the place where your discussion is happening so I can answer there.

== Fundraising localization: volunteers from outside the USA needed ==

''Please translate for your local community''

Hello All,

The Wikimedia Foundation's Fundraising team have begun our 'User Experience' project, with the goal of understanding the donation experience in different countries outside the USA and enhancing the localization of our donation pages. I am searching for volunteers to spend 30 minutes on a Skype chat with me, reviewing their own country's donation pages. It will be done on a 'usability' format (I will ask you to read the text and go through the donation flow) and will be asking your feedback in the meanwhile. 

The only pre-requisite is for the volunteer to actually live in the country and to have access to at least one donation method that we offer for that country (mainly credit/debit card, but also real-time banking like IDEAL, E-wallets, etc...) so we can do a live test and see if the donation goes through. ''All volunteers will be reimbursed of the donations that eventually succeed'' (and they will be low amounts, like 1-2 dollars)

By helping us you are actually helping thousands of people to support our mission of free knowledge across the world. Please sing up and help us with our 'User Experience' project! :)
If you are interested (or know of anyone who could be) please email ppena@wikimedia.org. All countries needed (excepting USA)!

Thanks!<br />

== Wikidata phase 1 (language links) coming to this Wikipedia ==

[[File:Wikidata-logo-en.svg|150px|right]]
Sorry for writing in English. I hope someone can translate this locally.

[[d:|Wikidata]] has been in development for a few months now. It is now time for the roll-out of the first part of it on your Wikipedia. Phase 1 is the support for the management of language links. It is already being used on the Hungarian, Hebrew, Italian and English Wikipedias. The next step is to enable the extension on all other Wikipedias. We have currently planned this for March 6.

=== What is Wikidata? ===
Wikidata is a central place to store data that you can usually find in infoboxes. Think of it as something like Wikimedia Commons but for data (like the number of inhabitants of a country or the length of a river) instead of multimedia. The first part of this project (centralizing language links) is being rolled out now. The more fancy things will follow later.

=== What is going to happen? ===
Language links in the sidebar are going to come from Wikidata in addition to the ones in the wiki text. To edit them, scroll to the bottom of the language links, and click edit. You no longer need to maintain these links by hand in the wiki text of the article.

=== Where can I find more information and ask questions? ===
Editors on en:wp have created a [[:en:Wikipedia:Wikidata|great page with all the necessary information for editors]] and there is also an [[meta:Wikidata/Deployment Questions|FAQ for this deployment]]. Please ask questions you might have on [[meta:Wikidata/Deployment Questions|the FAQ’s discussion page]].

=== I want to be kept up to date about Wikidata ===

[[File:Wikidata-logo-en.svg|150px|right]]
Sorry for writing in English. I hope someone can translate this locally. If you understand German better than English you can have a look at the announcement on [[:de:Wikipedia:Kurier]].

As I annonced 2 weeks ago, [[d:|Wikidata]] phase 1 (language links) has been deployed here today. Language links in the sidebar are coming from Wikidata in addition to the ones in the wiki text. To edit them, scroll to the bottom of the language links, and click edit. You no longer need to maintain these links by hand in the wiki text of the article.

'''Where can I find more information and ask questions?'''
Editors on en:wp have created a [[:en:Wikipedia:Wikidata|great page with all the necessary information for editors]] and there is also an [[meta:Wikidata/Deployment Questions|FAQ for this deployment]]. It'd be great if you could bring this to this wiki if that has not already happened. Please ask questions you might have on [[meta:Talk:Wikidata/Deployment Questions|the FAQ’s discussion page]].

== Convert complex templates to Lua to make them faster and more powerful ==

<small>(Please consider translating this message for the benefit of your fellow Wikimedians)</small>

Greetings. As you might have seen on the [https://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/03/11/lua-templates-faster-more-flexible-pages/ Wikimedia tech blog] or the [http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-ambassadors/2013-March/000171.html tech ambassadors list], a new functionality called "Lua" is being enabled on all Wikimedia sites today. [[mw:Lua|Lua]] is a scripting language that enables you to write faster and more powerful MediaWiki templates.

If you have questions about how to convert existing templates to Lua (or how to create new ones), we'll be holding two support sessions on IRC next week: [http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?hour=02&min=00&sec=0&day=20&month=03&year=2013 one on Wednesday] (for Oceania, Asia & America) and [http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?hour=18&min=00&sec=0&day=22&month=03&year=2013 one on Friday] (for Europe, Africa & America); see [[m:IRC office hours]] for the details. If you can't make it, you can also get help at [[mw:Talk:Lua scripting]].

If you'd like to learn about this kind of events earlier in advance, consider becoming a [[m:Tech/Ambassadors|Tech ambassador]] by subscribing to the [https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikitech-ambassadors mailing list]. You will also be able to help your fellow Wikimedians have a voice in technical discussions and be notified of important decisions.

== Wikidata phase 2 (infoboxes) coming to this Wikipedia ==

[[File:Wikidata-logo-en.svg|150px|right]]
Sorry for writing in English. I hope someone can translate this. If you understand German better than English you can have a look at the announcement on [[:de:Wikipedia:Kurier]].

A while ago the first phase of [[d:|Wikidata]] was enabled on this Wikipedia. This means you are getting the language links in each article from Wikidata. It is soon time to enable the second phase of Wikidata (infoboxes) here. We have already done this on the [[http://blog.wikimedia.de/2013/03/27/you-can-have-all-the-data/ first 11 Wikipedias]] (it, he, hu, ru, tr, uk, uz, hr, bs, sr, sh) and things are looking good. The next step is English Wikipedia. This is planned for April 8. '''If everything works out fine we will deploy on all remaining Wikipedias on April 10.''' I will update [[m:Wikidata/Deployment Questions#When_will_this_be_deployed_on_my_Wikipedia.3F|this part of the FAQ]] if there are any issues forcing us to change this date. I will also sent another note to this village pump once the deployment is finished.

'''What will happen once we have phase 2 enabled here?'''
Once it is enabled in a few days you will be able to make use of the structured data that is available on Wikidata in your articles/infoboxes. It includes things like the symbol for a chemical element, the ISBN for a book or the top level domain of a country. (None of this will happen automatically. Someone will have to change the article or infobox template for this to happen!)

'''How will this work?'''
There are two ways to access the data:
* Use a parser function like <nowiki>{{#property:p169}}</nowiki> in the wiki text of the article on Yahoo!. This will return “[[d:Q14086|Marissa Mayer]]” as she is the [[d:Property:P169|chief executive officer]] of the [[d:Q37093|company]].
* For more complicated things you can use Lua. The documentation for this is [[mw:Extension:WikibaseClient/Lua|here]].

We are working on expanding the parser function so you can for example use <nowiki>{{#property:chief executive officer}}</nowiki> instead of <nowiki>{{#property:p169}}</nowiki>. The complete plan for this is [[meta:Wikidata/Notes/Inclusion syntax|here]].

'''Where can I test this?'''
You can already test it on [http://test2.wikipedia.org test2].

'''Where can I find more information and ask questions?'''
We have collected the main questions in an [[meta:Wikidata/Deployment Questions|FAQ for this deployment]]. Please ask questions you might have on [[meta:Talk:Wikidata/Deployment Questions|the FAQ’s discussion page]].

Today all the remaining Wikipedias followed.

'''What does having phase 2 enabled here mean?'''
You are now able to make use of the structured data that is available on Wikidata in your articles/infoboxes. It includes things like the symbol for a chemical element, the ISBN for a book or the top level domain of a country. (None of this will happen automatically. Someone will have to change the article or infobox template for this to happen!) The current state is just the beginning though. It will be extended based on feedback we get from you now.

'''How will this work?'''
There are two ways to access the data:
* Use a parser function like <nowiki>{{#property:p159}}</nowiki> in the wiki text of the article on Wikimedia Foundation. This will return “[[d:Q62|San Francisco]]” as that is the [[d:Property:P159|headquarter location]] of the [[d:180|non-profit]].
* For more complicated things you can use Lua. The documentation for this is [[mw:Extension:WikibaseClient/Lua|here]].

We are working on expanding the parser function so you can for example use <nowiki>{{#property:headquarter location}}</nowiki> instead of <nowiki>{{#property:p159}}</nowiki>. The complete plan for this is [[meta:Wikidata/Notes/Inclusion syntax|here]].

'''Where can I test this?'''
You can test it on [http://test2.wikipedia.org test2] if you don't want to do it in an article here.

'''Where can I find more information and ask questions?'''
We have collected the main questions in an [[meta:Wikidata/Deployment Questions|FAQ for this deployment]]. Please ask questions you might have on [[meta:Talk:Wikidata/Deployment Questions|the FAQ’s discussion page]].

To stay up-to-date on everything happening around Wikidata please [[meta:Global message delivery/Targets/Wikidata|subscribe]] to the newsletter that is delivered weekly to subscribed user’s talk pages.


We are excited about taking yet another step towards allowing all Wikipedias share structured data and collect and curate it together.

== [en] Change to section edit links ==

<div class="mw-content-ltr">
The default position of the "edit" link in page section headers is going to change soon. The "edit" link will be positioned adjacent to the page header text rather than floating opposite it.

Section edit links will be to the immediate right of section titles, instead of on the far right. If you're an editor of one of the wikis which already implemented this change, nothing will substantially change for you; however, scripts and gadgets depending on the previous implementation of section edit links will have to be adjusted to continue working; however, nothing else should break even if they are not updated in time.

[[m:Change to section edit links|Detailed information and a timeline]] is available on meta.

Ideas to do this all the way to 2009 at least. It is often difficult to track which of several potential section edit links on the far right is associated with the correct section, and many readers and anonymous or new editors may even be failing to notice section edit links at all, since they read section titles, which are far away from the links.

== Pywikipedia is migrating to git ==

Hello, Sorry for English but It's very important for bot operators so I hope someone translates this.
[[mw:PWB|Pywikipedia]] is migrating to Git so after July 26, SVN checkouts won't be updated If you're using Pywikipedia you have to switch to git, otherwise you will use out-dated framework and your bot might not work properly. There is a [[mw:Manual:Pywikipediabot/Gerrit|manual]] for doing that and a [https://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/07/21/pywikipediabot-moving-to-git-on-july-26/ blog post] explaining about this change in non-technical language.

== VisualEditor and your Wikipedia ==

''(Please translate this message)''

Greetings,

The Wikimedia Foundation will soon turn on [[mw:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]] for all users, all the time on your Wikipedia. Right now your Wikipedia does not have any local documents on VisualEditor, and we hope that your community can change that. To find out about how you can help with translations visit the [[mw:VisualEditor/TranslationCentral|TranslationCentral for VisualEditor]] and read the easy instructions on [[mw:VisualEditor/Portal/Localization|bringing information to your Wikipedia]]. The [[mw:Help:VisualEditor/User_guide|User Guide]] and the [[mw:Help:VisualEditor/FAQ|FAQ]] are very important to have in your language.
 
We want to find out as much as we can from you about VisualEditor and how it helps your Wikipedia, and having local pages is a great way to start. We also encourage you to [[mw:VisualEditor/Feedback|leave feedback on Mediawiki]] where the community can offer ideas, opinions, and point out bugs that may still exist in the software that need to be reported to [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=VisualEditor Bugzilla]. 
If you are able to speak for the concerns of others in English on MediaWiki or locally I encourage you to help your community to be represented in this process.

If you can help translate the user interface for VisualEditor to your language, you can help with that as well. [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special%3AMessageGroupStats&x=D&group=ext-visualeditor#sortable:3=desc Translatewiki] has open tasks for translating VisualEditor. A direct link to translate the user interface is [https://translatewiki.net/wiki/Special:Translate?filter=!translated&action=translate&group=ext-visualeditor here].  You can see how we are doing with those translations [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special%3AMessageGroupStats&x=D&group=ext-visualeditor#sortable:3=desc here]. You need an account on Translatewiki to translate.  This account is free and easy to create.

If we can help your community in any way with this process, please let me know and I will do my best to assist your Wikipedia with this |exciting development. You can contact me on my [[m:User_talk:Keegan (WMF)|meta talk page]] or by [[Special:EmailUser/Keegan (WMF)|email]].  You can also contact [[mw:User_talk:PEarley_(WMF)|Patrick Earley]] for help with translations and documents on Mediawiki.  We look forward to working with you to bring the VisualEditor experience to your Wikipedia! [[:m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[:m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]]) 30 Lengua 2013 à 19:13 (UTC)

''(This message is in English, please translate as needed)''

Greetings!  

[[mw:Echo|Notifications]] will inform users about new activity that affects them on this wiki in a unified way: for example, this new tool will let you know when you have new talk page messages, edit reverts, mentions or links -- and is designed to augment (rather than replace) the watchlist. The Wikimedia Foundation's editor engagement team developed this tool (code-named 'Echo') earlier this year, to help users contribute more productively to MediaWiki projects. 

We're now getting ready to bring Notifications to almost all other Wikimedia sites, and are aiming for a 22 October deployment, as outlined in [[mw:Echo/Release_Plan_2013|this release plan]]. It is important that notifications is translated for all of the languages we serve.  

There are three major points of translation needed to be either done or checked:
*[https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special%3AMessageGroupStats&x=D&group=ext-echo#sortable:3=desc Echo on translatewiki for user interface] - you must have an account on translatewiki to translate
*[https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special%3AMessageGroupStats&x=D&group=ext-thanks#sortable:3=desc Thanks on translatewiki for user interface] - you must have an account on translatewiki to translate
*[[mw:Help:Notifications|Notifications help on mediawiki.org]].  This page can be hosted after translation on mediawiki.org or we can localize it to this Wikipedia.  You do not have to have an account to translate on mediawiki, but single-user login will create it for you there if you follow the link.
:*[[mw:Echo/Release Plan 2013#Checklist|Checklist]]

Please let us know if you have any questions, suggestions or comments about this new tool.

== Speak up about the trademark registration of the Community logo. ==

Hi all, 

Please join the consultation about the Community logo that represents Meta-Wiki: [[:m:Community Logo/Request for consultation]].

This community consultation was commenced on September 24. The following day, two individuals filed a legal opposition against the registration of the Community logo.

The question is whether the Wikimedia Foundation should seek a collective membership mark with respect to this logo or abandon its registration and protection of the trademark. 

We want to make sure that everyone get a chance to speak up so that we can get clear direction from the community.  We would therefore really appreciate the community's help in translating this announcement from English so that everyone is able to understand it.

== Introducting Beta Features ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
''(Apologies for writing in English. Please translate if necessary)''

We would like to let you know about [[mw:About_Beta_Features|Beta Features]], a new program from the Wikimedia Foundation that lets you try out new features before they are released for everyone.

Think of it as a digital laboratory where community members can preview upcoming software and give feedback to help improve them. This special preference page lets designers and engineers experiment with new features on a broad scale, but in a way that's not disruptive.

Beta Features is now ready for testing on [[mw:Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|MediaWiki.org]]. It will also be released on Wikimedia Commons and MetaWiki this Thursday, 7 November. Based on test results, the plan is to release it on all wikis worldwide on 21 November, 2013.

Here are the first features you can test this week:
* [[mw:Multimedia/About_Media_Viewer|Media Viewer]] — view images in large size or full screen
* [[mw:VisualEditor/Beta_Features/Formulae|VisualEditor Formulæ]] (for wikis with [[mw:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]]) — edit algebra or equations on your pages
* [[mw:Typography_Update|Typography Refresh]] —  make text more readable (coming Thursday)

Would you like to try out Beta Features now? After you log in on MediaWiki.org, a small 'Beta' link will appear next to your 'Preferences'. Click on it to see features you can test, check the ones you want, then click 'Save'. Learn more on the [[mw:About_Beta_Features|Beta Features page]].

After you've tested Beta Features, please let the developers know what you think on [[mw:Talk:About_Beta_Features|this discussion page]] -- or report any bugs [http://wmbug.com/new?product=MediaWiki%20extensions&component=BetaFeatures here on Bugzilla]. You're also welcome to join [[m:IRC_office_hours#Upcoming_office_hours|this IRC office hours chat]] on Friday, 8 November at 18:30 UTC. 

Beta Features was developed by the Wikimedia Foundation's Design, Multimedia and VisualEditor teams. Along with other developers, they will be adding new features to this experimental program every few weeks. They are very grateful to all the community members who helped create this project — and look forward to many more productive collaborations in the future.

Enjoy, and don't forget to let developers know what you think!  [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]]) 5 Nabändüru 2013 à 20:35 (UTC)

== Call for comments on draft trademark policy ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
Hi all, 

The Wikimedia legal team invites you to participate in the development of the new Wikimedia trademark policy.

The [[:wmf:Trademark policy|current trademark policy]] was introduced in 2009 to protect the [[:wmf:Wikimedia trademarks|Wikimedia marks]]. We are now updating this policy to better balance permissive use of the marks with the legal requirements for preserving them for the community. The new draft trademark policy is ready for your review [[:m:Trademark policy|here]], and we encourage you to discuss it [[:m:Talk:Trademark policy|here]].

==VisualEditor coming to this wiki==
Hello. Please excuse the English. I would be grateful if you can translate this message!

VisualEditor is coming to this project on December 2, 2013. VisualEditor is software in development to allow people to edit pages in MediaWiki without needing to learn wikitext syntax (like typing <nowiki>[[</nowiki> to start a link). It is already available and in use on some Wikipedia projects. Please see [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/FAQ]] for more information.

When this software arrives, you will have the option to use it or to use the current wikitext editor. When you press “edit”, you will get the new VisualEditor software. To use the wikitext editor, you can press “edit source”. For more information about how to use VisualEditor, see [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/User guide]].

We hope that this software will be useful to people in your community, and we can really use your help to make it better! Please let us know if you find any problems. If you're willing and able, please [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/How to report a bug|report the issue in bugzilla]] in the [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=VisualEditor&format=guided "VisualEditor" product]. If you would prefer not, please explain the issue you found on the [[mw:VisualEditor/Feedback|central feedback page]] on mediawiki.org. Once VisualEditor is made available, if there are any urgent problems, like an unexpected bug suddenly causing widespread severe problems, please e-mail James Forrester, the Product Manager, at jforrester@wikimedia.org for immediate attention.

We would also appreciate help with translation with the pages about VisualEditor here and on MediaWiki.org, and its user interface. To translate the user interface, start by creating an account at [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Special%3AFirstSteps&type=on TranslateWiki]. Once your account request is approved, all you need to do is select your language from [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special%3AMessageGroupStats&x=D&group=ext-visualeditor#sortable:3=desc this list]. This will give you a list of individual lines and paragraphs. The English original will be on one side, with the option to “edit” on the other. Pressing “edit” will open an edit window where you can work.

The User Guide is another important document.  To translate this, simply go to [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/User_guide|the MediaWiki.org page]], and select “translate this page”.  Your language should be available from the drop-down menu on the right.  If you want to help with translations and would like to talk about how, please leave a message for me on my talk page.

Thank you, and happy editing! --[[Utilisateur:Mdennis (WMF)|Mdennis (WMF)]] ([[Discussion utilisateur:Mdennis (WMF)|discussion]]) 19 Nabändüru 2013 à 19:35 (UTC)

== Request for comment on Commons: Should Wikimedia support MP4 video? ==

''I apologize for this message being only in English. Please translate it if needed to help your community.''

The Wikimedia Foundation's [[mw:Multimedia|multimedia team]] seeks community guidance on a proposal to support the [[w:MP4|MP4 video format]]. This digital video standard is used widely around the world to record, edit and watch videos on mobile phones, desktop computers and home video devices. It is also known as [[w:MP4|H.264/MPEG-4 or AVC]].

Supporting the MP4 format would make it much easier for our users to view and contribute video on Wikipedia and Wikimedia projects -- and video files could be offered in dual formats on our sites, so we could continue to support current open formats (WebM and Ogg Theora). 

However, MP4 is a patent-encumbered format, and using a proprietary format would be a departure from our current practice of only supporting open formats on our sites -- even though the licenses appear to have acceptable legal terms, with only a small fee required. 

We would appreciate your guidance on whether or not to support MP4. Our Request for Comments presents views both in favor and against MP4 support, based on opinions we’ve heard in our discussions with community and team members. 

[[commons:Commons:Requests for comment/MP4 Video|Please join this RfC -- and share your advice]].

All users are welcome to participate, whether you are active on Commons, Wikipedia, other Wikimedia project -- or any site that uses content from our free media repository.

You are also welcome to join tomorrow's [[m:IRC_office_hours#Upcoming_office_hours|Office hours chat on IRC]],  this Thursday, January 16, at 19:00 UTC, if you would like to discuss this project with our team and other community members.

We look forward to a constructive discussion with you, so we can make a more informed decision together on this important topic. [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]]) 16 Nyenye 2014 à 06:46 (UTC)

== Universal Language Selector will be enabled by default again on this wiki by 21 February 2014 ==

<div class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
On January 21 2014 the MediaWiki extension [[mw:Universal Language Selector|Universal Language Selector]] (ULS) was [[mw:Universal Language Selector/Announcement Jan2014|disabled]] on this wiki. A new preference was added for logged-in users to turn on ULS. This was done to prevent slow loading of pages due to ULS webfonts, a behaviour that had been observed by the Wikimedia Technical Operations team on some wikis. 

We are now ready to enable ULS again. The temporary preference to enable ULS will be removed. A [[commons:File:ULS-font-checkbox.png|new checkbox]] has been added to the Language Panel to enable/disable font delivery. This will be unchecked by default for this wiki, but can be selected at any time by the users to enable webfonts. This is an interim solution while we improve the feature of webfonts delivery.

== Changes to the default site typography coming soon ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"> 
This week, the typography on Wikimedia sites will be updated for all readers and editors who use the default "Vector" skin. This change will involve new serif fonts for some headings, small tweaks to body content fonts, text size, text color, and spacing between elements. The schedule is: 

* '''April 1st''': non-Wikipedia projects will see this change live
* '''April 3rd''': Wikipedias will see this change live

This change is very similar to the "Typography Update" Beta Feature that has been available on Wikimedia projects since November 2013. After several rounds of testing and with feedback from the community, this Beta Feature will be disabled and successful aspects enabled in the default site appearance. Users who are logged in may still choose to use another skin, or alter their [[Special:MyPage/vector.css|personal CSS]], if they prefer a different appearance. Local [[MediaWiki:Common.css|common CSS]] styles will also apply as normal, for issues with local styles and scripts that impact all users.

Greetings— and sorry for writing in English, please translate if it will help your community,

The Wikimedia Foundation's [[mw:Multimedia|Multimedia team]] is happy to announce that [[mw:Multimedia/About Media Viewer|Media Viewer]] was just released on this site today. 

Media Viewer displays images in larger size when you click on their thumbnails, to provide a better viewing experience.

The tool has been tested extensively across all Wikimedia wikis over the past six months as a [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|Beta Feature]] and has been [[mw:Multimedia/Media_Viewer/Release_Plan#Timeline|released]] to the largest Wikipedias, all language Wikisources, and the English Wikivoyage already.

If you do not like this feature, you can easily turn it off by clicking on "Disable Media Viewer" at the bottom of the screen, pulling up the information panel (or in your [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-rendering|your preferences]]) whether you have an account or not. Learn more [[mw:Help:Multimedia/Media_Viewer#How_can_I_turn_off_this_feature.3F|in this Media Viewer Help page]].

Please let us know if you have any questions or comments about Media Viewer. You are invited to [[mw:Talk:Multimedia/About_Media_Viewer|share your feedback in this discussion on MediaWiki.org]] in any language, to help improve this feature. You are also welcome to [https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/media-viewer-1-all?c=announce-all take this quick survey in English], [https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/media-viewer-1-fr en français], [https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/media-viewer-1-es o español].

We hope you enjoy Media Viewer. Many thanks to all the community members who helped make it possible. - [[mw:User:Fabrice Florin (WMF)|Fabrice Florin (WMF)]]  ([[m:User talk:Fabrice Florin (WMF)|talk]]) 19 Föndo 2014 à 21:54 (UTC)

== Letter petitioning WMF to reverse recent decisions ==

The Wikimedia Foundation recently created a new feature, "superprotect" status. The purpose is to prevent pages from being edited by elected administrators -- but permitting WMF staff to edit them. It has been put to use in only one case: to protect the deployment of the Media Viewer software on German Wikipedia, in defiance of a clear decision of that community to disable the feature by default, unless users decide to enable it.

If you oppose these actions, please add your name to this letter. If you know non-Wikimedians who support our vision for the free sharing of knowledge, and would like to add their names to the list, please ask them to sign an identical version of the letter on change.org.

== Process ideas for software development ==

<div class=”mw-content-ltr”>
’’My apologies for writing in English.’’

Hello,

I am notifying you that a brainstorming session has been [[:m:Community Engagement (Product)/Process ideas|started on Meta]] to help the Wikimedia Foundation increase and better affect community participation in software development across all wiki projects. Basically, how can you be more involved in helping to create features on Wikimedia projects?  We are inviting all interested users to voice their ideas on how communities can be more involved and informed in the product development process at the Wikimedia Foundation. It would be very appreciated if you could translate this message to help inform your local communities as well.

I and the rest of [[:m:Community Engagement (Product)|my team]] welcome you to participate. We hope to see you on Meta.

Kind regards,

== VisualEditor available on Internet Explorer 11 ==

<div class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
[[File:VisualEditor-logo.svg|right|frameless|200x200px]]

VisualEditor will become available to users of Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 during today's regular software update.  Support for some earlier versions of Internet Explorer is being worked on.  If you encounter problems with VisualEditor on Internet Explorer, please contact the Editing team by leaving a message at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Feedback|VisualEditor/Feedback]] on Mediawiki.org.  Happy editing, [[:mw:User:Elitre (WMF)|Elitre (WMF)]] 11 Mvuka 2014 à 07:29 (UTC).

== VisualEditor News #8—2014 ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
<div style="float:right;width:230px;margin-left:1em;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;padding:1em;">
[[File:VisualEditor-logo.svg|200px|center]][[File:TemplateData GUI editor with two parameters.png|alt=|centre|frameless|230x230px]]'''Did you know?''' 
<div class="thumbcaption" style="font-size: 90%;">
TemplateData is a separate program that organizes information about the parameters that can be used in a template.  VisualEditor reads that data, and uses it to populate its simplified template dialogs.

With the new TemplateData editor, it is easier to add information about parameters, because the ones you need to use are pre-loaded. 

See [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:TemplateData|the help page for TemplateData]] for more information about adding TemplateData.  [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:VisualEditor/User guide|The user guide]] has information about how to use VisualEditor.
</div></div>

Since the last newsletter, the [[mw:VisualEditor|Editing]] team has reduced technical debt, simplified some workflows for template and citation editing, made major progress on Internet Explorer support, and fixed [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=349619&order=priority%252Cbug_severity&product=VisualEditor&query_format=advanced&resolution=FIXED&target_milestone=VE-deploy-2014-08-14&target_milestone=VE-deploy-2014-08-21&target_milestone=VE-deploy-2014-08-28&target_milestone=VE-deploy-2014-09-04&target_milestone=VE-deploy-2014-09-11&target_milestone=VE-deploy-2014-09-18&target_milestone=VE-deploy-2014-09-25&target_milestone=VE-deploy-2014-10-02 over 125 bugs and requests]. Several performance improvements were made, especially to the system around re-using references and reference lists.  Weekly updates are posted [[mw:VisualEditor/status|on Mediawiki.org]]. 

There were three issues that required urgent fixes: a deployment error that meant that many buttons didn't work correctly (bugs [[bugzilla:69856|69856]] and [[bugzilla:69864|69864]]), a problem with edit conflicts that left the editor with nowhere to go ([[bugzilla:69150|bug 69150]]), and a problem in Internet Explorer 11 that replaced some categories with a link to the system message [[MediaWiki:Badtitletext]] ([[bugzilla:70894|bug 70894]]) when you saved. The developers apologize for the disruption, and thank the people who reported these problems quickly.

=== Increased support for devices and browsers ===
'''Internet Explorer 10 and 11 users now have access to VisualEditor'''. This means that about 5% of Wikimedia's users will now get an "Edit" tab alongside the existing "Edit source" tab.  Support for Internet Explorer 9 is planned for the future.

'''Tablet users''' browsing the site's mobile mode now have the option of using a mobile-specific form of VisualEditor. More editing tools, and availability of VisualEditor on smartphones, is planned for the future. The '''mobile version of VisualEditor''' was tweaked to show the context menu for citations instead of basic references ([[bugzilla:68897|bug 68897]]).  A bug that broke the editor in iOS was corrected and released early ([[bugzilla:68949|bug 68949]]). For mobile tablet users, three bugs related to scrolling were fixed ([[bugzilla:66697|bug 66697]], [[bugzilla:68828|bug 68828]], [[bugzilla:69630|bug 69630]]). You can use VisualEditor on the mobile version of Wikipedia from your tablet by clicking on the cog in the top-right when editing a page and choosing which editor to use.

=== TemplateData editor ===
'''The tool for editing [[mw:Extension:TemplateData|TemplateData]] has been deployed to 30 more Wikipedias this week.'''  Other Wikipedias and some other projects may receive access next month.  This tool makes it easier to add TemplateData to the template's documentation.  When the tool is enabled, it will add a button above every editing window for a template (including documentation subpages).  To use it, edit the template page or a subpage, and then click the "{{int:templatedata-editbutton}}" button at the top.  Read [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:TemplateData|the help page for TemplateData]].  You can test the TemplateData editor [[mw:Template:Sandbox/doc|in a sandbox at Mediawiki.org]].  Remember that TemplateData should be placed either on a documentation subpage '''''or''''' on the template page itself.  Only one block of TemplateData will be used per template.

=== Other changes ===
Several interface '''messages and labels were changed''' to be simpler, clearer, or shorter, based on feedback from translators and editors. The formatting of dialogs was changed, and more changes to the appearance will be coming soon, when VisualEditor implements the new MediaWiki theme from Design.  (A preview of the theme is [[toollabs:oojs-ui/oojs-ui/demos/index.html#widgets-mediawiki-vector-ltr|available on Labs]] for developers.)  The team also made some improvements for users of the '''Monobook''' skin that improved the size of text in toolbars and fixed selections that overlapped menus.

VisualEditor-MediaWiki now supplies the <code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">mw-redirect</code> and <code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">mw-disambig</code> class on '''links to redirects and disambiguation pages''', so that user gadgets that colour in these types of links can be created.

'''Templates' fields can be marked as '<code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">required</code>' '''in TemplateData.  If a parameter is marked as required, then you cannot delete that field when you add a new template or edit an existing one ([[bugzilla:60358|bug 60358]]). 

Language support improved by making annotations use bi-directional isolation (so they display correctly with cursoring behaviour as expected) and by fixing a bug that crashed VisualEditor when trying to edit a page with a <code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">dir</code> attribute but no <code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">lang</code> set ([[bugzilla:69955|bug 69955]]). 

=== Looking ahead ===
The team posts details about planned work on the [[mw:VisualEditor/Roadmap|VisualEditor roadmap]].  The VisualEditor team [[mw:Cite-from-id|plans to add '''auto-fill features''']] '''for citations''' soon, perhaps in late October.        

The team is also working on support for '''adding rows and columns to tables''', and early work for this may appear within the month.  <mark>Please comment on the design [[:mw:VisualEditor/Design/Table editor#Design Workflow for comments|at Mediawiki.org]].</mark>

In the future, real-time collaborative editing may be possible in VisualEditor.  Some early preparatory work for this was recently done. 

=== Supporting your wiki ===

At Wikimania, several developers gave presentations about VisualEditor.  A translation sprint focused on improving access to VisualEditor was supported by many people.  '''Deryck Chan''' was the top translator.  Special honors also go to '''संजीव कुमार (Sanjeev Kumar)''', '''Robby''', '''Takot''', '''Bachounda''', '''Bjankuloski06''' and '''Ата'''.  A [[mw:VisualEditor/Translathon#Highlights from the Translathon|summary]] of the work achieved by the translation community is available.  Thank you all for your work.      

This was the first translatable VisualEditor newsletter, so thanks to everybody who made this possible!

== Meta RfCs on two new global groups ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">Hello all, 

There are currently requests for comment open on meta to create two new global groups. The first is a group for members of the OTRS permissions queue, which would grant them autopatrolled rights on all wikis except those who opt-out. That proposal can be found at [[m:Requests for comment/Creation of a global OTRS-permissions user group]]. The second is a group for Wikimedia Commons admins and OTRS agents to view deleted file pages through the 'viewdeletedfile' right on all wikis except those who opt-out. The second proposal can be found at [[m:Requests for comment/Global file deletion review]].

We would like to hear what you think on both proposals. Both are in English; if you wanted to translate them into your native language that would also be appreciated.

It is possible for individual projects to opt-out, so that users in those groups do not have any additional rights on those projects. To do this please start a local discussion, and if there is consensus you can request to opt-out of either or both at [[m:Stewards' noticeboard]].

== Global AbuseFilter ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">Hello,

[[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Extension:AbuseFilter|AbuseFilter]] is a MediaWiki extension used to detect likely abusive behavior patterns, like pattern vandalism and spam. In 2013, [[m:Special:Mylanguage/Global AbuseFilter|Global AbuseFilters]] were enabled on a limited set of wikis including Meta-Wiki, MediaWiki.org, Wikispecies and (in early 2014) all the "[https://noc.wikimedia.org/conf/highlight.php?file=small.dblist small wikis]". Recently, global abuse filters were enabled on "[https://noc.wikimedia.org/conf/highlight.php?file=medium.dblist medium sized wikis]" as well. These filters are currently managed by stewards on Meta-Wiki and have shown to be very effective in preventing mass spam attacks across Wikimedia projects. However, there is currently no policy on how the global AbuseFilters will be managed although there are proposals. There is an ongoing [[m:Requests for comment/Global AbuseFilter|request for comment]] on policy governing the use of the global AbuseFilters. In the meantime, specific wikis can opt out of using the global AbuseFilter. These wikis can simply add a request to [[m:Global AbuseFilter/Opt-out wikis|this list]] on Meta-Wiki. More details can be found on [[m:Special:Mylanguage/Global AbuseFilter/2014 announcement|this page]] at Meta-Wiki. If you have any questions, feel free to ask on [[m:Talk:Global AbuseFilter|m:Talk:Global AbuseFilter]].

VisualEditor is also available on the mobile version of Wikipedia. Log in and click the pencil icon to open the page you want to edit. Click on the gear-shaped settings button in the upper-right corner to pick which editor to use. Choose "{{int:Mobile-frontend-editor-visual-editor}}" to use VisualEditor, or "{{int:Mobile-frontend-editor-source-editor}}" to use the wikitext editor.

It will remember whether you used wikitext or VisualEditor, and use the same editor the next time you edit an article.  

[[:mw:VisualEditor/User guide|The user guide]] has information about how to use VisualEditor. Not all features are available on the mobile website.
</div></div>

Since the last newsletter, the [[mw:VisualEditor|Editing Team]] has fixed many [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=355757&product=VisualEditor&query_format=advanced&resolution=FIXED&target_milestone=VE-deploy-2014-10-09&target_milestone=VE-deploy-2014-10-16&target_milestone=VE-deploy-2014-10-23%20%281.25wmf5%29&target_milestone=VE-deploy-2014-10-29%20%281.25wmf6%29 bugs and requests], and worked on support for editing tables and for using non-Latin languages. Their weekly updates are posted [[mw:VisualEditor/status|on Mediawiki.org]]. Informal notes from the recent quarterly review were posted [[m:WMF_Metrics_and_activities_meetings/Quarterly_reviews/Editing/October_2014|on Meta]]. 

=== Recent improvements ===
Basic support for '''inserting tables''' and changing the number of rows and columns in them was just introduced to Wikipedias. Advanced features, like dragging columns to different places, will be added later. 

To help editors find the most important items more quickly, some items in the toolbar menus are now hidden behind '''a "{{int:Ooui-toolbar-more}}" item''', such as "{{int:Visualeditor-annotationbutton-underline-tooltip}}" in the styling menu.

The French Wikipedia should see '''better search results''' for links, templates, and media because the [[:mw:Help:CirrusSearch|new search engine]] was turned on for everyone there. This change is expected at the Chinese and German Wikipedias this week, and the following week at the English Wikipedia. 

The "pawn" system has been mostly replaced. Bugs in this system sometimes added a chess pawn character to wikitext. The replacement provides better support for '''non-Latin languages''', with full support hopefully coming soon. 

VisualEditor is now provided to editors who use '''Internet Explorer''' 10 or 11 on desktop and mobile devices. Internet Explorer 9 is not supported yet.

The '''keyboard shortcuts''' for items in the toolbar menus are now shown in the menus.  

VisualEditor will replace the existing design with a '''new theme''' from the [[mw:Design|User Experience/Design group]]. The appearance of dialog boxes has already changed in the mobile version. The appearance on desktops will change soon. You are welcome to compare [[toollabs:oojs-ui/oojs-ui/demos/index.html#widgets-apex-vector-ltr|the old "Apex" design]] and [[toollabs:oojs-ui/oojs-ui/demos/index.html#widgets-mediawiki-vector-ltr|the new "MediaWiki" theme]] which will replace it.

Several bugs were fixed for internal and external links. Improvements to MediaWiki's search solved an annoying problem: If you searched for the full name of the page or file that you wanted to link, sometimes the search engine could not find the page. A link inside a template to a local page that does not exist will now show red, exactly as it does when reading the page. Due to an error, for about two weeks this also affected all external links inside templates. Opening an auto-numbered link node like [http://example.com] with the keyboard used to open the wrong link tool. These problems have all been fixed.

=== TemplateData ===

'''The tool for quickly editing [[mw:Extension:TemplateData|TemplateData]] has been deployed to all Wikimedia Foundation wikis on Thursday, 6 November.''' This tool was already available on the biggest 40 Wikipedias, and now all wikis will have access to it. This tool makes it easier to add TemplateData to the template's documentation. When the tool is enabled, it will add a button above every editing window for a template (including documentation subpages). To use it, edit the template or a subpage, and then click the "{{int:templatedata-editbutton}}" button at the top. Read [[mw:Help:TemplateData|the help page for TemplateData]] to learn more about it. You can test the TemplateData editor [[mw:Template:Sandbox/doc|in a sandbox at Mediawiki.org]]. Remember that TemplateData should be placed either on a documentation subpage '''''or''''' on the template page itself. Only one block of TemplateData will be used per template.

You can use the '''new autovalue setting''' to pre-load a value into a template. This can be used to substitute dates, as in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=632356794&oldid=632356402 this example], or to add the most common value for that parameter. The autovalue can be overridden by the editor, by typing something else in the field.

In TemplateData, you may '''define a parameter as "required"'''.  The template dialog box in VisualEditor will warn editors if they leave a "required" parameter empty, and they will not be able to delete that parameter. If the template can function without this parameter, then please mark it as "{{int:Templatedata-doc-param-status-suggested}}" or "{{int:Templatedata-doc-param-status-optional}}" in TemplateData instead.

=== Looking ahead ===

The VisualEditor team [[mw:Cite-from-id|plans to add '''auto-fill features''']] '''for citations''' soon. The appearance of the media search dialog will improve, to make picking between possible images easier and more visual. The team posts details about planned work on the [[mw:VisualEditor/Roadmap|VisualEditor roadmap]].        

The [[mw:Help:VisualEditor/User_guide|user guide]] is being updated to add information about editing tables.
The translations of the user guide for most languages except Spanish, French, and Dutch are significantly out of date. '''Please help [https://www.mediawiki.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Translate&group=page-Help%3AVisualEditor%2FUser+guide&action=page&filter= complete the current translations]''' for users who speak your language.

== VisualEditor News #10—2014 ==

'''Did you know?'''
<div class="thumbcaption" style="font-size:90%;">
Basic table editing is now available in VisualEditor. You can add and remove rows and columns from tables at the click of a button.

[[:mw:VisualEditor/User guide|The user guide]] has more information about how to use VisualEditor.
</div>
</div>

Since the last newsletter, the [[mw:VisualEditor|Editing Team]] has fixed many bugs and worked on table editing and performance. Their weekly status reports are posted [[mw:VisualEditor/status|on mediawiki.org]]. Upcoming plans are posted at the [[mw:VisualEditor/Roadmap|VisualEditor roadmap]].

'''VisualEditor was deployed to several hundred remaining wikis''' as an opt-in [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|beta feature]] at the end of November, except for most Wiktionaries (which depend heavily upon templates) and all Wikisources (which await integration with [[mw:Extension:Proofread Page|ProofreadPage]]).

=== Recent improvements ===

Basic support for '''editing tables''' is now available. You can add and delete tables, add and remove rows and columns, set or remove a caption for a table, and merge cells together. To change the contents of a cell, double-click inside it. More features will be added in the coming months. In addition, VisualEditor now ignores broken, invalid <code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">rowspan</code> and <code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">colspan</code> elements, instead of trying to repair them.

You can now use '''find and replace''' in VisualEditor, reachable through the tool menu or by pressing <kbd><code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">^ Ctrl</code></kbd>+<kbd><code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">F</code></kbd> or <kbd><code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">⌘ Cmd</code></kbd>+<kbd><code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">F</code></kbd>.

You can now create and edit simple <code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr"><nowiki><blockquote></nowiki></code> paragraphs for quoting and indenting content. This changes a "{{Int:Visualeditor-formatdropdown-format-paragraph}}" into a "{{Int:Visualeditor-formatdropdown-format-blockquote}}".

Some '''new keyboard sequences''' can be used to format content. At the start of the line, typing "<code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">* </code>" will make the line a bullet list; "<code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">1.</code>" or "<code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">#</code>" will make it a numbered list; "<code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">==</code>" will make it a section heading; "<code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">: </code>" will make it a blockquote. If you didn't mean to use these tools, you can press undo to undo the formatting change.

There are also two other keyboard sequences: "<code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr"><nowiki>[[</nowiki></code>" for opening the link tool, and "<code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr"><nowiki>{{</nowiki></code>" for opening the template tool, to help experienced editors. The existing standard keyboard shortcuts, like <kbd><code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">^ Ctrl</code></kbd>+<code class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">K</code> to open the link editor, still work. 

If you add a category that has been redirected, then VisualEditor now adds its target. Categories without description pages show up as red.

You can again create and edit '''galleries''' as wikitext code.

=== Looking ahead ===

The current VisualEditor design will be replaced with a '''new theme''' designed by the [[mw:Design|User Experience group]]. The new theme will be visible for desktop systems at mediawiki.org in late December and on other sites in early January. (You can see a developer preview of [[toollabs:oojs-ui/oojs-ui/demos/index.html#widgets-apex-vector-ltr|the old "Apex" theme]] and [[toollabs:oojs-ui/oojs-ui/demos/index.html#widgets-mediawiki-vector-ltr|the new "MediaWiki" one]] which will replace it.)

The Editing team [[mw:Cite-from-id|plans to add '''auto-fill features''']] '''for citations''' in January.

Planned changes to the media search dialog will make choosing between possible images easier.

== VisualEditor News #1—2015 ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

[[File:VisualEditor-logo.svg|300px|right|frameless|alt=VisualEditor]]
Since the last newsletter, the  [[mw:VisualEditor|Editing Team]] has fixed many bugs and worked on VisualEditor's appearance, the coming Citoid reference service, and support for languages with complex input requirements. 
Status reports are posted [[mw:VisualEditor/status|on mediawiki.org]]. Upcoming plans are posted at the  [[mw:VisualEditor/Roadmap|VisualEditor roadmap]].  

The Wikimedia Foundation has named [[:mw:Wikimedia_Engineering/2014-15_Goals#Top_departmental_priorities_for_Q3_.28January-March_2015.29|its top priorities for this quarter]] (January to March). The first priority is making VisualEditor ready for deployment by default to all new users and logged-out users at the remaining large Wikipedias. You can help identify these requirements. <mark>There will be weekly '''triage meetings '''which''' will be open to volunteers''' beginning Wednesday, 11 February 2015 at [http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20150211T12&p1=224&ah=1 12:00 (noon) PST] (20:00 UTC). </mark> Tell Vice President of Engineering [[:foundation:User:Damon_Sicore_(WMF)|Damon Sicore]], Product Manager [[:mw:User:Jdforrester_(WMF)|James Forrester]] and other team members which bugs and features are most important to you. The decisions made at these meetings will determine what work is necessary for this quarter's goal of making VisualEditor ready for deployment to new users. The presence of volunteers who enjoy contributing MediaWiki code is particularly appreciated. Information about how to join the meeting will be posted at [[:mw:Talk:VisualEditor/Portal|mw:Talk:VisualEditor/Portal]] shortly before the meeting begins. 

Due to some breaking changes in MobileFrontend and VisualEditor, VisualEditor was not working correctly on the mobile site for a couple of days in early January. The teams apologize for the problem. 

=== Recent improvements === 

The''' new design for VisualEditor''' aligns with MediaWiki's [[mw:Frontend standards group|Front-End Standards]] as led by the Design team. Several new versions of the [[mw:OOjs UI|OOjs UI]] library have also been released, and these also affect the appearance of VisualEditor and other MediaWiki software extensions. Most changes were minor, like changing the text size and the amount of white space in some windows. Buttons are consistently color-coded to indicate whether the action:
* starts a new task, like opening the {{int:visualeditor-toolbar-savedialog}} dialog: <span style="background-color: #015ccc; color:white"> blue </span>, 
* takes a constructive action, like inserting a citation:  <span style="background-color: #008c6d; color:white"> green </span>,
* might remove or lose your work, like removing a link:  <span style="background-color: #a7170f; color:white">  red </span>,  or  
* is neutral, like opening a link in a new browser window:  <span style="color: 757575">  gray </span>.  
The '''TemplateData editor''' has been completely re-written to use a different design based on the same OOjs UI system as VisualEditor.   ([https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T67815 T67815], [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T73746 T73746].) This change fixed a couple of existing bugs and improved usability. ([https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T73077 T73077], [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T73078 T73078].) 

'''Search and replace''' in long documents is now faster. It does not highlight every occurrence if there are more than 100 on-screen at once.([https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T78234 T78234].)

Editors at the Hebrew and Russian Wikipedia requested the ability to use VisualEditor in the "Article Incubator" or drafts namespace. ([https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T86688 T86688], [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T87027 T87027].) If your community would like '''VisualEditor enabled on another namespace''' on your wiki, then you can file a request in Phabricator. Please include a link to a community discussion about the requested change.

=== Looking ahead === 

The Editing team will soon add '''auto-fill features''' '''for citations'''. The '''[[mw:Citoid|Citoid service]]''' takes a [[w:URL|URL]] or [[w:en: Digital object identifier|DOI]] for a reliable source, and returns a pre-filled, pre-formatted bibliographic citation. After creating it, you will be able to change or add information to the citation, in the same way that you edit any other pre-existing citation in VisualEditor. Support for ISBNs, PMIDs, and other identifiers is planned. Later, editors will be able to contribute to the Citoid service's definitions for each website, to improve precision and reduce the need for manual corrections.   

We will need editors to help test the '''new design of the special character inserter''', especially if you speak Welsh, Breton, or another language that uses diacritics or special characters extensively. The new version should be available for testing next week. Please contact [[:en:User:Whatamidoing (WMF)|User:Whatamidoing (WMF)]] if you would like to be notified when the new version is available. After the special character tool is completed, VisualEditor will be deployed to all users at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Rollouts|Phase 5 Wikipedias]]. This will affect about 50 mid-size and smaller Wikipedias, including '''Afrikaans, Azerbaijani, Breton, Kyrgyz, Macedonian, Mongolian, Tatar, and Welsh'''. The date for this change has not been determined.

== IMPORTANT: Admin activity review ==
Hello. A policy regarding the removal of "advanced rights" (administrator, bureaucrat, etc) was adopted by [[:m:Requests for comment/Activity levels of advanced administrative rights holders|global community consensus]] in 2013. According to this policy, the [[:m:stewards|stewards]] are reviewing administrators' activity on all Wikimedia Foundation wikis with no inactivity policy. To the best of our knowledge, your wiki does not have a formal process for removing "advanced rights" from inactive accounts. This means that the stewards will take care of this according to the [[:m:Admin activity review|admin activity review]].

We have determined that the following users meet the inactivity criteria (no edits and no log actions for more than 2 years):
#Reder (administrator)

These users will receive a notification soon, asking them to start a community discussion if they want to retain some or all of their rights. If the users do not respond, then their advanced rights will be removed by the stewards.

However, if you as a community would like to create your own activity review process superseding the global one, want to make another decision about these inactive rights holders, or already have a policy that we missed, then please notify the [[:m:Stewards' noticeboard|stewards on Meta-Wiki]] so that we know not to proceed with the rights review on your wiki. Thanks, [[meta:User:Openbk|Openbk]] ([[meta:User talk:Openbk|talk]]) 6 Fulundïgi 2015 à 17:34 (UTC)

== Inspire Campaign: Improving diversity, improving content ==

This March, we’re organizing an Inspire Campaign to encourage and support new ideas for improving gender diversity on Wikimedia projects. Less than 20% of Wikimedia contributors are women, and many important topics are still missing in our content. We invite all Wikimedians to participate. If you have an idea that could help address this problem, please get involved today! The campaign runs until March 31.

All proposals are welcome - research projects, technical solutions, community organizing and outreach initiatives, or something completely new! Funding is available from the Wikimedia Foundation for projects that need financial support. Constructive, positive feedback on ideas is appreciated, and collaboration is encouraged - your skills and experience may help bring someone else’s project to life. Join us at the Inspire Campaign and help this project better represent the world’s knowledge!

VisualEditor is now substantially faster.  In many cases, opening the page in VisualEditor is now faster than opening it in the wikitext editor. The new system has improved the code speed by 37% and [[:mw:RESTBase|network speed]] by almost 40%.

The Editing team is slowly adding '''auto-fill features''' '''for citations'''. This is currently available only at the French, Italian, and English Wikipedias.  The '''[[:mw:Citoid|Citoid service]]''' takes a [[:en:URL|URL]] or [[:en:Digital object identifier|DOI]] for a reliable source, and returns a pre-filled, pre-formatted bibliographic citation. After creating it, you will be able to change or add information to the citation, in the same way that you edit any other pre-existing citation in VisualEditor.

Later, editors will be able to improve precision and reduce the need for manual corrections by contributing to the Citoid service's definitions for each website.

Citoid requires good [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:TemplateData|TemplateData]] for your citation templates.  If you would like to request this feature for your wiki, please post a request in the [[phab:tag/citoid/|Citoid project on Phabricator]]. Include links to the TemplateData for the most important citation templates on your wiki.

The '''special character inserter''' has been improved, based upon feedback from active users.  After this, VisualEditor was made available to all users of Wikipedias on the [[:mw:VisualEditor/Rollouts|Phase 5]] list on 30 March.  This affected 53 mid-size and smaller Wikipedias, including '''Afrikaans''', '''Azerbaijani''', '''Breton''', '''Kyrgyz''', '''Macedonian''', '''Mongolian''', '''Tatar''', and''' Welsh'''. 

Work continues to support languages with complex requirements, such as Korean and Japanese.  These languages use [[w:input method editor|input method editors]] ("IMEs”).  Recent improvements to cursoring, backspace, and delete behavior will simplify typing in VisualEditor for these users.

The design for the image selection process is now using a "masonry fit" model.  Images in the search results are displayed at the same height but at variable widths, similar to bricks of different sizes in a masonry wall, or the [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:Images#Mode parameter|"packed" mode in image galleries]].  This style helps you find the right image by making it easier to see more details in images.

You can now '''drag and drop categories''' to re-arrange their order of appearance ​on the page.

The pop-up window that appears when you click on a reference, image, link, or other element, is called the "context menu".  It now displays additional useful information, such as the destination of the link or the image's filename.  The team has also added an explicit "Edit" button in the context menu, which helps new editors open the tool to change the item.

'''Invisible templates are marked by a puzzle piece icon''' so they can be interacted with. Users also will be able to see and edit HTML anchors now in section headings.

Users of the TemplateData GUI editor can now set a string as an optional text for the 'deprecated' property in addition to boolean value, which lets you tell users of the template what they should do instead. ([https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T90734 T90734])

=== Looking ahead ===
The special character inserter in VisualEditor will soon use the same special character list as the wikitext editor.  Admins at each wiki will also have the option of creating a custom section for frequently used characters at the top of the list.  Instructions for customizing the list will be posted [[:mw:VisualEditor/Special_characters|at mediawiki.org]].

The team is discussing a test of VisualEditor with new users at the English Wikipedia, to see whether they have met their goals of making VisualEditor suitable for those editors.  The timing is unknown, but might be relatively soon. ([https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T90666 T90666])

== [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015/Call for candidates|Nominations are being accepted for 2015 Wikimedia Foundation elections]] ==

''This is a message from the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015/Committee|2015 Wikimedia Foundation Elections Committee]]. [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015/MassMessages/Accepting nominations|Translations]] are available.''
[[File:Wikimedia Foundation logo - vertical (2012-2016).svg|100px|right]]
Greetings,

I am pleased to announce that nominations are now being accepted for the 2015 Wikimedia Foundation Elections. This year the Board and the FDC Staff are looking for a diverse set of candidates from regions and projects that are traditionally under-represented on the board and in the movement as well as candidates with experience in technology, product or finance. To this end they have [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015/Call for candidates|published letters]] describing what they think is needed and, recognizing that those who know the community the best are the community themselves, the election committee is [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015|accepting nominations]] for community members you think should run and will reach out to those nominated to provide them with information about the job and the election process.

This year, elections are being held for the following roles:

''Board of Trustees''<br/>
The Board of Trustees is the decision-making body that is ultimately responsible for the long term sustainability of the Foundation, so we value wide input into its selection.  There are three positions being filled. More information about this role can be found at [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/Board elections/2015|the board elections page]].    

''Funds Dissemination Committee (FDC)''<br/>
The Funds Dissemination Committee (FDC) makes recommendations about how to allocate Wikimedia movement funds to eligible entities.  There are five positions being filled. More information about this role can be found at [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/FDC elections/2015|the FDC elections page]].

''Funds Dissemination Committee (FDC) Ombud''<br/>
The FDC Ombud receives complaints and feedback about the FDC process, investigates complaints at the request of the Board of Trustees,  and summarizes the investigations and feedback for the Board of Trustees on an annual basis.  One position is being filled.  More information about this role can be found at [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/FDC Ombudsperson elections/2015|the FDC Ombudsperson elections page]]. 

The candidacy submission phase lasts from 00:00 UTC April 20 to 23:59 UTC May 5 for the Board and from 00:00 UTCApril 20 to 23:59 UTC April 30 for the FDC and FDC Ombudsperson. This year, we are accepting both self-nominations and nominations of others. More information on this election and the nomination process can be found on [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015|the 2015 Wikimedia elections page on Meta-Wiki]].

Please feel free to post a note about the election on your project's village pump. Any questions related to the election can be posted on the talk page on Meta, or sent to the election committee's mailing list, board-elections -at- wikimedia.org

== Content Translation now available as a beta feature on this Wikipedia ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

Hello, we enabled [[mw:Content_translation|Content Translation]] today as a beta feature on this Wikipedia. Content Translation is a tool that will help editors quickly create new articles by translating from a Wikipedia page in another language. The tool is currently in use in over [[mw:Content_translation/Languages#Available_languages|40 Wikipedias]] as a beta feature. To start translating, you will have to enable the beta feature and go to [[Special:ContentTranslation]] or to your contributions page and create a new translation by selecting the source language, the article name you wish to translate and target language i.e. the language of the new article you are creating. If the article already exists then a warning will be displayed. After you translate the article, you can publish it directly as a new page on the Wikipedia. In case the article gets created by another user while you were translating, you will see an option to save the newly published translation under your user namespace. The number of published pages can be seen on the [[Special:CXStats|Content Translation stats page]].

Since, this is the first time we have installed the tool on this Wikipedia, there are chances that there may be some problems or service disruptions which we are not yet aware of. We will be monitoring the usage to check for any failures or issues, but please do let us know on the [[:mw:Talk:Content_translation|Content Translation talk page]] or through [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T97540 Phabricator] if you spot any problems that prevent you from using the tool. For more information, please read [[:mw:Content_translation#Try_the_tool|about how to use the tool]]. You can also view a [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Content_Translation_Screencast_%28English%29.webm short screencast] on how to use Content Translation. My apologies for writing this announcement only in English. Please feel free to translate this message. Thank you. [[m:User_talk:Runab WMF|Runa Bhattacharjee]] 30 Ngubë 2015 à 15:49 (UTC)

[[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Manual:Pywikibot|Pywikibot]] (then "Pywikipediabot") was started back in 2002.

== VisualEditor News #3—2015 ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

<div style="margin:0.5em;width:230px;{{#switch:ltr|rtl=float:left;margin-left:0;|#default=float:right;margin-right:0;}}border:1px solid #AAA;padding:0.5em;">
[[File:VisualEditor-logo.svg|200x70px|center|alt=VisualEditor]]

'''Did you know?'''  
<div class="thumbcaption" style="font-size: 90%;">
When you click on a link to an article, you now see more information:
<br><br>
[[File:VisualEditor-context menu-link tool.png|alt=Screenshot showing the link tool's context menu|centre|frameless|230x230px]]
<br>
The link tool has been re-designed:  
<br><br>
[[File:VisualEditor link tool 2015.png|alt=Screenshot of the link inspector|centre|frameless|230x230px]]
<br>
There are separate tabs for linking to internal and external pages.
[[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/User guide|The user guide]] has more information about how to use VisualEditor.
</div></div>

Since the last newsletter, the [[mw:VisualEditor|Editing Team]] has created new interfaces for the link and citation tools and fixed many bugs and changed some elements of the design.  Some of these bugs affected users of VisualEditor on mobile devices. Status reports are posted [[mw:VisualEditor/changelog|on mediawiki.org]]. The worklist for April through June is available [[phab:project/sprint/board/1113/|in Phabricator]]. 

A [[m:Research:VisualEditor's_effect_on_newly_registered_editors/May_2015_study|test of VisualEditor's effect on new editors]] at the English Wikipedia has just completed the first phase.  During this test, half of newly registered editors had VisualEditor automatically enabled, and half did not.  The main goal of the study is to learn which group was more likely to save an edit and to make productive, unreverted edits.  Initial [[m:Research:VisualEditor's_effect_on_newly_registered_editors/May_2015_study#Results|results will be posted at Meta]] later this month.    
=== Recent improvements ===
'''Auto-fill features''' '''for citations''' are available at a few Wikipedias through the '''[[:mw:Citoid|citoid service]]'''.  Citoid takes a [[:en:URL|URL]] or [[:en:Digital object identifier|DOI]] for a reliable source, and returns a pre-filled, pre-formatted bibliographic citation.  If Citoid is enabled on your wiki, then the design of the citation workflow changed during May.  All citations are now created inside a single tool.  Inside that tool, choose the tab you want ({{int:citoid-citeFromIDDialog-mode-auto}}, {{int: citoid-citeFromIDDialog-mode-manual}}, or {{int:citoid-citeFromIDDialog-mode-reuse}}).  The cite button is now labeled with the word "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-cite-label}}" rather than a book icon, and the autofill citation dialog now has a more meaningful label, "{{Int:Citoid-citeFromIDDialog-lookup-button}}", for the submit button.

The '''link tool''' has been redesigned based on feedback from Wikipedia editors and user testing.  It now has two separate sections:  one for links to articles and one for external links. When you select a link, its pop-up context menu shows the name of the linked page, a thumbnail image from the linked page, Wikidata's description, and appropriate icons for disambiguation pages, redirect pages and empty pages (where applicable). Search results have been reduced to the first five pages.  Several bugs were fixed, including a dark highlight that appeared over the first match in the link inspector.  ([[phab:T98085|T98085]])

The '''special character inserter''' in VisualEditor now uses the same special character list as the wikitext editor.  Admins at each wiki can also create a custom section for frequently used characters at the top of the list.  Please read the instructions for customizing the list [[mw:VisualEditor/Special_characters|at mediawiki.org]].  Also, there is now a tooltip to describing each character in the special character inserter. ([[phab:T70425|T70425]])

Several improvements have been made to '''templates'''.  When you search for a template to insert, the list of results now contains descriptions of the templates. The parameter list inside the template dialog now remains open after inserting a parameter from the list, so that users don’t need to click on "{{Int:visualeditor-dialog-transclusion-add-param}}" each time they want to add another parameter.  ([[phab:T95696|T95696]]) The team added a '''new property for TemplateData''', "{{int: templatedata-doc-param-example}}", for template parameters.  This optional, translatable property will show up when there is text describing how to use that parameter. ([[phab:T53049|T53049]])

The '''design''' of the main toolbar and several other elements have changed slightly, to be consistent with the MediaWiki theme.  In the Vector skin, individual items in the menu are separated visually by pale gray bars.  Buttons and menus on the toolbar can now contain both an icon and a text label, rather than just one or the other. This new design feature is being used for the cite button on wikis where the Citoid service is enabled.

The team has released a long-desired improvement to the handling of '''non-existent images'''.  If a non-existent image is linked in an article, then it is now visible in VisualEditor and can be selected, edited, replaced, or removed.

=== Let's work together ===
* Share your ideas and ask questions at [https://www.mediawiki.org/w/index.php?title=VisualEditor/Feedback&lqt_method=talkpage_new_thread mw:VisualEditor/Feedback]. 
* The weekly task triage meetings continue to be open to volunteers, usually on Wednesday at 12:00 (noon) PDT (19:00 UTC).  Learn how to join the meetings and how to nominate bugs at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings|mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings]].  You do not need to attend the meeting to nominate a bug for consideration as a Q4 blocker, though.  Instead, go to Phabricator and "associate" the [[phab:tag/editing_department_2014_15_q4_blockers/|VisualEditor Q4 blocker project]] with the bug.  
* If your Wikivoyage, Wikibooks, Wikiversity, or other community wants to have VisualEditor made available by default to contributors, then please contact [[:m:User:Jdforrester (WMF)|James Forrester]]. 
* If you would like to request the Citoid automatic reference feature for your wiki, please post a request in the [[phab:tag/citoid/|Citoid project on Phabricator]]. Include links to the [[:mw:Help:TemplateData|TemplateData]]  for the most important citation templates on your wiki. 
*The team is planning the second VisualEditor-related "translathon" for July. Please follow [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T91108 this task on Phabricator] for details and updates! Announcements will follow in due course.

Hi everyone.

Over the last few years, the Wikimedia Foundation has [http://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/08/01/future-https-wikimedia-projects/ been working] towards enabling [[m:Special:MyLanguage/HTTPS|HTTPS]] by default for all users, including unregistered ones, for better privacy and security for both readers and editors. This has taken a long time, as there were different aspects to take into account. Our servers haven't been ready to handle it. The Wikimedia Foundation has had to balance sometimes conflicting goals.

[https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/06/12/securing-wikimedia-sites-with-https/ Forced HTTPS] has just been implemented on all Wikimedia projects. Some of you might already be aware of this, as a few Wikipedia language versions were converted to HTTPS last week and the then affected communities were notified.

Most of Wikimedia editors shouldn't be affected at all. If you edit as registered user, you've probably already had to log in through HTTPS. We'll keep an eye on this to make sure everything is working as it should. Do get in touch with [[:m:HTTPS#Help!|us]] if you have any problems after this change or contact me if you have any other questions.

== Wikidata: Access to data from arbitrary items is coming ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
(Sorry for writing in English)

When using data from Wikidata on Wikipedia and other sister projects, there is currently a limitation in place that hinders some use cases: data can only be accessed from the corresponding item. So, for example, the Wikipedia article about Berlin can only get data from the Wikidata item about Berlin but not from the item about Germany. This had technical reasons. We are now removing this limitation. It is already done for many projects. Your project is one of the next ones. We will roll out this feature here on August 12.

We invite you to play around with this new feature if you are one of the people who have been waiting for this for a long time. If you have technical issues/questions with this you can come to [[d:Wikidata:Contact the development team]].

A note of caution: Please be careful with how many items you use for a single page. If it is too many pages, loading might get slow. We will have to see how the feature behaves in production to see where we need to tweak and how.

How to use it, once it is enabled:
* Parser function: <nowiki>{{#property:P36|from=Q183}}</nowiki> to get the capital from the item about Germany
* Lua: see [[mw:Extension:Wikibase Client/Lua]]

== Wikidata: Access to data from arbitrary items is here ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
(Sorry for writing in English)

Hi everyone,

As I have previously announced here we have now enabled the arbitrary access feature here. This means from now on you can make use of data from any Wikidata item in any article here. Before you could for example only access data about Berlin in the article about Berlin. If you want to find out more or have questions please come to [[d:Wikidata:Arbitrary access]]. I hope this will open up great possibilities for you and make your work easier.

Since the last newsletter, the [[mw:VisualEditor|Editing Team]] have been working on mobile phone support. They have fixed many bugs and improved language support.  They post weekly status reports [[mw:VisualEditor/changelog|on mediawiki.org]]. Their workboard is available [[phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]].  Their [[mediawikiwiki:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are improving language support and functionality on mobile devices.   

=== Wikimania ===
The team attended Wikimania 2015 in Mexico City. There they participated in the Hackathon and met with individuals and groups of users. They also made several presentations about [[c:File:How_we_made_VisualEditor_faster.pdf|VisualEditor]] and the [[:c:File:Wikimania_2015_–_Editing_Department_–_Beyond_Editing.pdf|future of editing]]. 

Following Wikimania, we announced winners for the [https://translatewiki.net/wiki/Project:VisualEditor/2015_Translathon VisualEditor 2015 Translathon]. Our thanks and congratulations to users ''Halan-tul'', ''Renessaince'', ''<span lang="ne" dir="ltr">जनक राज भट्ट</span> (Janak Bhatta)'', ''Vahe Gharakhanyan'', ''Warrakkk'', and ''Eduardogobi''.

For '''interface messages''' (translated at [https://translatewiki.net translatewiki.net]), we saw the initiative affecting 42 languages. The average progress in translations across all languages was 56.5% before the translathon, and 78.2% after ('''+21.7%'''). In particular, Sakha improved from 12.2% to 94.2%; Brazilian Portuguese went from 50.6% to 100%; Taraškievica went from 44.9% to 85.3%; Doteli went from 1.3% to 41.2%. Also, while 1.7% of the messages were outdated across all languages before the translathon, the percentage dropped to 0.8% afterwards (-0.9%).   

For '''documentation messages''' (on mediawiki.org), we saw the initiative affecting 24 languages. The average progress in translations across all languages was 26.6% before translathon, and 46.9% after ('''+20.3%''').  There were particularly notable achievements for three languages. Armenian improved from 1% to 99%; Swedish, from 21% to 99%, and Brazilian Portuguese, from 34% to 83%. Outdated translations across all languages were reduced from 8.4% before translathon to 4.8% afterwards (-3.6%).   

[https://translatewiki.net/wiki/Project:VisualEditor/2015_Translathon#Graphs_(interface_messages_only) We published some graphs] showing the effect of the event on the Translathon page. We thank the translators for participating and the translatewiki.net staff for facilitating this initiative.   

=== Recent improvements ===
'''Auto-fill features for citations''' can be enabled on each Wikipedia.  The tool uses the '''[[:mw:Citoid|citoid service]]''' to convert a [[:en:URL|URL]] or [[:en:Digital object identifier|DOI]] into a pre-filled, pre-formatted bibliographic citation. You can see an animated GIF of the quick, [[mediawikiwiki:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/GIFs#Auto-citing_a_source|simple process at mediawiki.org]].  So far, about a dozen Wikipedias have enabled the auto-citation tool.  To enable it for your wiki, follow the [[mediawikiwiki:Special:MyLanguage/Citoid/Enabling_Citoid_on_your_wiki|instructions at mediawiki.org]].

Your wiki can customize the first section of the '''special character inserter''' in VisualEditor. Please follow the [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/Special_characters|instructions at mediawiki.org]] to put the characters you want at the top. 
In other changes, if you need to fill in a [[:mw:CAPTCHA|CAPTCHA]] and get it wrong, then you can click to get a new one to complete.  VisualEditor can now display and edit [[mediawikiwiki:Extension:Graph|Vega-based graphs]]. If you use the Monobook skin, VisualEditor's appearance is now more consistent with other software.     

=== Future changes ===
The team will be changing the '''appearance of selected links''' inside VisualEditor. The purpose is to make it easy to see whether your cursor is inside or outside the link.  When you select a link, the link label (the words shown on the page) will be enclosed in a faint box.  If you place your cursor inside the box, then your changes to the link label will be part of the link.  If you place your cursor outside the box, then it will not.  This will make it easy to know when new characters will be added to the link and when they will not.

On the English Wikipedia, 10% of newly created accounts are now offered both the visual and the wikitext editors.  A [[m:Research:VisualEditor's_effect_on_newly_registered_editors/May_2015_study|recent controlled trial]] showed no significant difference in survival or productivity for new users in the short term.  New users with access to VisualEditor were very slightly less likely to produce results that needed reverting.  You can learn more about this by watching a video of the [[mediawikiwiki:Wikimedia_Research/Showcase#July_2015|July 2015 Wikimedia Research Showcase]].  The proportion of new accounts with access to both editing environments will be gradually increased over time. Eventually all new users have the choice  between the two editing environments.

=== Let's work together ===
* Share your ideas and ask questions at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Feedback|mw:VisualEditor/Feedback]].  This feedback page is now using [[mw:Flow|Flow]] instead of LiquidThreads.
* <mark>Can you read and type in Korean or Japanese?</mark> Language engineer [[mw:User:DChan (WMF)|David Chan]]  needs people who know which tools people use to type in some languages. If you speak Japanese or Korean, you can help him test support for these languages. Please see the instructions at [[mw:VisualEditor/IME Testing#What to test|mediawiki.org]] if you can help.  
* If your wiki would like '''VisualEditor enabled on another namespace''', you can file a request in Phabricator. Please include a link to a community discussion about the requested change.
* Please file requests for language-appropriate "{{Int:visualeditor-annotationbutton-bold-tooltip}}" and "{{Int:visualeditor-annotationbutton-italic-tooltip}}" icons for the styling menu [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/maniphest/task/create/?projects=PHID-PROJ-dafezmpv6huxg3taml24 in Phabricator].   
* The design research team wants to see how real editors work. Please [https://jfe.qualtrics.com/form/SV_6R04ammTX8uoJFP sign up for their research program]. 
* The weekly task triage meetings continue to be open to volunteers, usually on Tuesdays at 12:00 (noon) PDT (19:00 UTC).  Learn how to join the meetings and how to nominate bugs at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings|mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings]].  You do not need to attend the meeting to nominate a bug for consideration as a Q1 blocker, though.  Instead, go to Phabricator and "associate" the main [[phab:project/profile/483/|VisualEditor project]] with the bug.

VisualEditor can now display and edit [[mediawikiwiki:Extension:Graph|Vega-based graphs]]. If you use the Monobook skin, VisualEditor's appearance is now more consistent with other software.     

=== Future changes ===
The team will be changing the '''appearance of selected links''' inside VisualEditor. The purpose is to make it easy to see whether your cursor is inside or outside the link.  When you select a link, the link label (the words shown on the page) will be enclosed in a faint box.  If you place your cursor inside the box, then your changes to the link label will be part of the link.  If you place your cursor outside the box, then it will not.  This will make it easy to know when new characters will be added to the link and when they will not.

On the English Wikipedia, 10% of newly created accounts are now offered both the visual and the wikitext editors.  A [[m:Research:VisualEditor's_effect_on_newly_registered_editors/May_2015_study|recent controlled trial]] showed no significant difference in survival or productivity for new users in the short term.  New users with access to VisualEditor were very slightly less likely to produce results that needed reverting.  You can learn more about this by watching a video of the [[mediawikiwiki:Wikimedia_Research/Showcase#July_2015|July 2015 Wikimedia Research Showcase]].  The proportion of new accounts with access to both editing environments will be gradually increased over time. Eventually all new users have the choice  between the two editing environments.

=== Let's work together ===
* Share your ideas and ask questions at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Feedback|mw:VisualEditor/Feedback]].  This feedback page is now using [[mw:Flow|Flow]] instead of LiquidThreads.
* <mark>Can you read and type in Korean or Japanese?</mark> Language engineer [[mw:User:DChan (WMF)|David Chan]]  needs people who know which tools people use to type in some languages. If you speak Japanese or Korean, you can help him test support for these languages. Please see the instructions at [[mw:VisualEditor/IME Testing#What to test|mediawiki.org]] if you can help.  
* If your wiki would like '''VisualEditor enabled on another namespace''', you can file a request in Phabricator. Please include a link to a community discussion about the requested change.
* Please file requests for language-appropriate "{{Int:visualeditor-annotationbutton-bold-tooltip}}" and "{{Int:visualeditor-annotationbutton-italic-tooltip}}" icons for the styling menu [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/maniphest/task/create/?projects=PHID-PROJ-dafezmpv6huxg3taml24 in Phabricator].   
* The design research team wants to see how real editors work. Please [https://jfe.qualtrics.com/form/SV_6R04ammTX8uoJFP sign up for their research program]. 
* The weekly task triage meetings continue to be open to volunteers, usually on Tuesdays at 12:00 (noon) PDT (19:00 UTC).  Learn how to join the meetings and how to nominate bugs at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings|mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings]].  You do not need to attend the meeting to nominate a bug for consideration as a Q1 blocker, though.  Instead, go to Phabricator and "associate" the main [[phab:project/profile/483/|VisualEditor project]] with the bug.

== Introducing the Wikimedia public policy site ==

Hi all,

We are excited to introduce a new Wikimedia Public Policy site. The site includes resources and position statements on access, copyright, censorship, intermediary liability, and privacy. The site explains how good public policy supports the Wikimedia projects, editors, and mission.

Visit the public policy portal: https://policy.wikimedia.org/

Please help translate the [[m:Public policy|statements on Meta Wiki]]. You can [http://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/09/02/new-wikimedia-public-policy-site/ read more on the Wikimedia blog].

== Reimagining WMF grants report ==

''(My apologies for using English here, please help translate if you are able.)''

Last month, we asked for community feedback on [[m:Grants:IdeaLab/Reimagining WMF grants| a proposal to change the structure of WMF grant programs]]. Thanks to the 200+ people who participated!  '''[[m:Grants:IdeaLab/Reimagining_WMF_grants/Outcomes|
A report]]''' on what we learned and changed based on this consultation is now available.

Come read about the findings and next steps as WMF’s Community Resources team begins to implement changes based on your feedback. Your questions and comments are welcome on [[m:Grants talk:IdeaLab/Reimagining WMF grants/Outcomes|the outcomes discussion page]].

[[File:VisualEditor-logo.svg|200x70px|center|alt=VisualEditor]]
'''Did you know?'''  
<div class="thumbcaption" style="font-size: 90%;">  

You can use the visual editor on smartphones and tablets.<br><br>[[File:Switching edit modes to VisualEditor on Mobile web.png|alt=Screenshot showing the menu for switching from the wikitext editor to the visual editor|centre|frameless|230x230px]]<br>
Click the pencil icon to open the editor for a page.  Inside that, use the gear menu in the upper right corner to "{{int:mobile-frontend-editor-switch-visual-editor}}".

The editing button will remember which editing environment you used last time, and give you the same one next time.  The desktop site will be switching to a system similar to this one in the coming months.
<br><br>You can read and help translate [[:mw:VisualEditor/User guide|the user guide]], which has more information about how to use the visual editor.
</div></div>
Since the last newsletter, the [[mw:VisualEditor|VisualEditor Team]] has fixed many bugs, added new features, and made some small design changes.  They post weekly status reports [[mw:VisualEditor/changelog|on mediawiki.org]]. Their workboard is available [[phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]].  Their [[mediawikiwiki:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are improving support for languages like Japanese and Arabic, making it easier to edit on mobile devices, and providing rich-media tools for formulæ, charts, galleries and uploading.   
=== Recent improvements ===
'''Educational features:''' The first time ever you use the visual editor, it now draws your attention to the {{Int:visualeditor-annotationbutton-link-tooltip}} and {{Int:visualeditor-toolbar-cite-label}} tools.  When you click on the tools, it explains why you should use them. ([[Phab:T108620|T108620]]) Alongside this, the welcome message for new users has been simplified to make editing more welcoming. ([[Phab:T112354|T112354]])  More in-software educational features are planned.  

'''Links:'''  It is now easier to understand when you are adding text to a link and when you are typing plain text next to it. ([[Phab:T74108|T74108]], [[Phab:T91285|T91285]])  The editor now fully supports ISBN, PMID or RFC numbers. ([[Phab:T109498|T109498]], [[Phab:T110347|T110347]], [[Phab:T63558|T63558]])  These  [[:en:Help:Magic_links|"magic links"]] use a custom link editing tool.  

'''Uploads:'''  Registered editors can now '''upload images''' and other media to Commons while editing.  Click the new tab in the "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-insert}} {{int:visualeditor-dialogbutton-media-tooltip}}" tool.  You will be guided through the process without having to leave your edit.  At the end, the image will be inserted. This tool is limited to one file at a time, owned by the user, and licensed under Commons's standard license.  For more complex situations, the tool links to more advanced upload tools.  You can also drag the image into the editor.  This will be available in the wikitext editor later. 

'''Mobile:'''  Previously, the visual editor was available on the mobile Wikipedia site only on tablets. Now, editors can use it on all devices regardless of size if they wish. ([[Phab:T85630|T85630]])  Edit conflicts were previously broken on the mobile website. Edit conflicts can now be resolved in both wikitext and visual editors. ([[Phab:T111894|T111894]])  Sometimes templates and similar items could not be deleted on the mobile website.  Selecting them caused the on-screen keyboard to hide with some browsers.  Now there is a new "{{int:Visualeditor-contextitemwidget-label-remove}}" button, so that these things can be removed if the keyboard hides. ([[Phab:T62110|T62110]]) You can also edit table cells in mobile now.

'''Rich editing tools:'''  You can now add and edit '''sheet''' '''music''' in the visual editor. ([[Phab:T112925|T112925]])  There are separate tabs for advanced options, such as MIDI and Ogg audio files. ([[Phab:T114227|T114227]], [[Phab:T113354|T113354]])  When editing '''formulæ''' and other blocks, errors are shown as you edit.  It is also possible to edit some types of '''graphs'''; adding new ones, and support for new types, will be coming. 

On the '''English Wikipedia''', the visual editor is now automatically available to anyone who creates an account.  The preference switch was moved to the normal location, under [[Special:Preferences]].
=== Future changes ===
You will soon be able to '''switch from the wikitext to the visual editor''' after you start editing. ([[phab:T49779|T49779]]) Previously, you could only switch from the visual editor to the wikitext editor.  Bi-directional switching will make possible a '''single edit tab.''' ([[phab:T102398|T102398]]) This project will combine the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" and "{{int:visualeditor-ca-editsource}}" tabs into a single "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab, similar to the system already used on the mobile website.  The "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab will open whichever editing environment you used last time.

=== Let's work together ===
* Share your ideas and ask questions at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Feedback|VisualEditor/Feedback]].  This feedback page uses [[mw:Flow|Flow]] for discussions.
* <mark>Can you read and type in Korean or Japanese?</mark> Language engineer [[mw:User:DChan (WMF)|David Chan]] needs people who know which tools people use to type in some languages. If you speak Japanese or Korean, you can help him test support for these languages. Please see the instructions at [[mw:VisualEditor/IME Testing#What to test|What to test]] if you can help, and report it on Phabricator ([[phab:T110654|Korean]] - [[phab:T109818|Japanese]]) or on Wikipedia ([[:ko:위키백과:시각편집기/IME|Korean]] - [[:ja:Wikipedia:ビジュアルエディター/フィードバック/IME|Japanese]]).  
* Local admins can [[mediawikiwiki:Citoid/Enabling_Citoid_on_your_wiki|set up the Citoid automatic reference feature for your wiki]].  If you need help, then please post a request in the [[phab:tag/citoid/|Citoid project on Phabricator]]. Include links to the [[:mw:Help:TemplateData|TemplateData]] for the most important citation templates on your wiki.
* The weekly task triage meetings are open to volunteers.  Learn how to join the meetings and how to nominate bugs at [[:mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings|mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings]].  You do not need to attend the meeting to nominate a bug for consideration, though.  Instead, go to Phabricator and "associate" the main [[phab:project/profile/483/|VisualEditor project]] with the bug.

== Community Wishlist Survey ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr"> 

Hi everyone! Apologies for posting in English. Translations are very welcome.

The [[:m:Community Tech|Community Tech team]] at the Wikimedia Foundation is focused on building improved curation and moderation tools for experienced Wikimedia contributors. We're now starting a '''[[:m:2015 Community Wishlist Survey|Community Wishlist Survey]]''' to find the most useful projects that we can work on.

For phase 1 of the survey, we're inviting all active contributors to submit brief proposals, explaining the project that you'd like us to work on, and why it's important. Phase 1 will last for 2 weeks. In phase 2, we'll ask you to vote on the proposals. Afterwards, we'll analyze the top 10 proposals and create a prioritized wishlist.

While most of this process will be conducted in English, we're inviting people from any Wikimedia wiki to submit proposals. We'll also invite volunteer translators to help translate proposals into English. 

Your proposal should include: the problem that you want to solve, who would benefit, and a proposed solution, if you have one. You can submit your proposal on the Community Wishlist Survey page, using the entry field and the big blue button. We will be accepting proposals for 2 weeks, ending on November 23.

== Wikimania 2016 scholarships ambassadors needed ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Hello! [[wm2016:|Wikimania 2016]] scholarships will soon be open; by the end of the week we'll form the committee and we need your help, see [[wm2016:Special:MyLanguage/Scholarship committee|Scholarship committee]] for details.

If you want to carefully review nearly a thousand applications in January, you might be a perfect committee member. Otherwise, you can '''volunteer as "ambassador"''': you will observe all the committee activities, ensure that people from your language or project manage to apply for a scholarship, translate '''scholarship applications written in your language''' to English and so on. Ambassadors are allowed to ask for a scholarship, unlike committee members.

== Harassment consultation ==

{{int:Please-translate}}

The Community Advocacy team the Wikimedia Foundation has opened a consultation on the topic of '''harassment''' on [[m:Harassment consultation 2015|Meta]]. The consultation period is intended to run for one month from today, November 16, and end on December 17. Please share your thoughts there on harassment-related issues facing our communities and potential solutions. (Note: this consultation is not intended to evaluate specific cases of harassment, but rather to discuss the problem of harassment itself.)

== [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/MassMessages/2015 Free Bassel banner straw poll|Your input requested on the proposed #FreeBassel banner campaign]] ==

''This is a message regarding the [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/Banner|proposed 2015 Free Bassel banner]]. [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/MassMessages/2015 Free Bassel banner straw poll|Translations]] are available.''

Hi everyone,

This is to inform all Wikimedia contributors that a [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/Banner/Straw poll|straw poll seeking your involvement]] has just been started on Meta-Wiki.

As some of your might be aware, a small group of Wikimedia volunteers have proposed a banner campaign informing Wikipedia readers about the urgent situation of our fellow Wikipedian, open source software developer and Creative Commons activist, [[:w:Bassel Khartabil|Bassel Khartabil]]. An exemplary [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/Banner|banner]] and an [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/Banner|explanatory page]] have now been prepared, and translated into about half a dozen languages by volunteer translators.

We are seeking [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/Banner/Straw poll|your involvement to decide]] if the global Wikimedia community approves starting a banner campaign asking Wikipedia readers to call on the Syrian government to release Bassel from prison. We understand that a campaign like this would be unprecedented in Wikipedia's history, which is why we're seeking the widest possible consensus among the community.

Given Bassel's urgent situation and the resulting tight schedule, we ask everyone to [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/Banner/Straw poll|get involved with the poll and the discussion]] to the widest possible extent, and to promote it among your communities as soon as possible.

(Apologies for writing in English; please kindly [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Free Bassel/MassMessages/2015 Free Bassel banner straw poll|translate]] this message into your own language.)

Thank you for your participation!

== [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15|Get involved in Wikipedia 15!]] ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
''This is a message from the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]]. [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/MassMessages/Get involved|Translations]] are available.''

[[File:International-Space-Station wordmark blue.svg|right|200px]]

As many of you know, January 15 is Wikipedia’s 15th Birthday!

People around the world are getting involved in the celebration and have started adding their [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Events|events on Meta Page]]. While we are celebrating Wikipedia's birthday, we hope that all projects and affiliates will be able to utilize this celebration to raise awareness of our community's efforts.

Haven’t started planning? Don’t worry, there’s lots of ways to get involved. Here are some ideas:

* '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Events|Join/host an event]]'''. We already have more than 80, and hope to have many more.
* '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Media|Talk to local press]]'''. In the past 15 years, Wikipedia has accomplished extraordinary things. We’ve made a [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/15 years|handy summary]] of milestones and encourage you to add your own. More resources, including a [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Media#releases|press release template]] and [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Communications/Movement Communications Skills|resources on working with the media]], are also available.
* '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Material|Design a Wikipedia 15 logo]]'''. In place of a single icon for Wikipedia 15, we’re making dozens. Add your own with something fun and representative of your community. Just use the visual guide so they share a common sensibility.
* '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15/Events/Package#birthdaywish|Share a message on social media]]'''. Tell the world what Wikipedia means to you, and add #wikipedia15 to the post. We might re-tweet or share your message!

Everything is linked on the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia 15|Wikipedia 15 Meta page]]. You’ll find a set of ten data visualization works that you can show at your events, and a [[c:Category:Wikipedia15 Mark|list of all the Wikipedia 15 logos]] that community members have already designed.

If you have any questions, please contact [[m:User:ZMcCune (WMF)|Zachary McCune]] or [[m:User:JSutherland (WMF)|Joe Sutherland]].

Thanks and Happy nearly Wikipedia 15!<br />
-The Wikimedia Foundation Communications team

== VisualEditor News #6—2015 ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
<div style="margin:0.5em;width:230px;{{#switch:ltr|rtl=float:left;margin-left:0;|#default=float:right;margin-right:0;}}border:1px solid #AAA;padding:0.5em;">
[[File:VisualEditor-logo.svg|200x70px|center|alt=The visual editor]]
'''Did you know?'''  
<div class="thumbcaption" style="font-size: 90%;">  

A new, simpler system for editing will offer a single Edit button.  Once the page has opened, you can switch back and forth between visual and wikitext editing.      

[[File:VisualEditor single edit tab preference dialog.png|alt=Screenshot showing a pop-up dialog for switching from the wikitext editor to the visual editor|centre|frameless|230x230px]]<br>

If you prefer having separate edit buttons, then you can set that option in your preferences, either in a pop-up dialog the next time you open the visual editor, or by going to [[Special:Preferences]] and choosing the setting that you want: <br><br>[[File:VisualEditor single edit tab in preferences 2015-12-18.png|alt=Screenshot showing a drop-down menu in Special:Preferences|centre|frameless|230x230px]]

The current plan is for the default setting to have the Edit button open the editing environment you used most recently. <br><br>You can read and help translate [[:mw:VisualEditor/User guide|the user guide]], which has more information about how to use the visual editor.
</div></div>
''[[m:VisualEditor/Newsletter/2015/December|Read this in another language]]  •  [[:m:VisualEditor/Newsletter|Subscription list for this multilingual newsletter]]''

Since the last newsletter, the [[mw:VisualEditor|visual editor team]] has fixed many bugs and expanded the mathematics formula tool.  Their workboard is available [[phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]].  Their [[mediawikiwiki:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are improving support for languages such as Japanese and Arabic, and providing rich-media tools for formulæ, charts, galleries and uploading.   

=== Recent improvements ===
You can '''switch from the wikitext editor to the visual editor''' after you start editing.    
The '''LaTeX mathematics formula editor''' has been significantly expanded. ([[phab:T118616|T118616)]] You can see the formula as you change the LaTeX code.  You can click buttons to insert the correct LaTeX code for many symbols.  
=== Future changes ===
The '''single edit tab''' project will combine the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" and "{{int:visualeditor-ca-editsource}}" tabs into a single "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab, like the system already used on the mobile website.  ([[phab:T102398|T102398]], [[phab:T58337|T58337]])  Initially, the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab will open whichever editing environment you used last time.  Your last editing choice will be stored as a cookie for logged-out users and as an account preference for logged-in editors.  Logged-in editors will be able to set a default editor in the {{int:prefs-editing}} tab of [[Special:Preferences]] in the drop-down menu about "{{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs}}".   

The visual editor will be offered to all editors at the following Wikipedias in early 2016:  [[w:am:|Amharic]], [[w:bug:|Buginese]], [[w:cdo:|Min Dong]], [[w:cr:|Cree]], [[w:gv:|Manx]], [[w:hak:|Hakka]], [[w:hy:|Armenian]], [[w:ka:|Georgian]], [[w:pnt:|Pontic]], [[w:sh:|Serbo-Croatian]], [[w:ti:|Tigrinya]], [[w:xmf:|Mingrelian]], [[w:za:|Zhuang]], and [[w:zh-min-nan:|Min Nan]]. ([[phab:T116523|T116523]]) Please post your comments and the language(s) that you tested at [[:mw:Topic:St8y4ni42d0vr9cv|the feedback thread on mediawiki.org]].  The developers would like to know how well it works.  Please tell them what kind of computer, web browser, and keyboard you are using.  

In 2016, the '''feedback pages''' for the visual editor on many Wikipedias will be redirected to mediawiki.org. ([[phab:T92661|T92661]])

=== Testing opportunities ===
* Please try the new system for the '''single edit tab''' on [https://test2.wikipedia.org test2.wikipedia.org].  You can edit while logged out to see how it works for logged-out editors, or you can create a separate account to be able to set your account's preferences.  <mark>Please share your thoughts about the single edit tab system at [[mediawikiwiki:Topic:Suspcq0bf5nd3gsd|the feedback topic on mediawiki.org]] or [https://jfe.qualtrics.com/form/SV_6R04ammTX8uoJFP sign up for formal user research]</mark> (type "single edit tab" in the question about other areas you're interested in).  The new system has not been finalized, and your feedback can affect the outcome.  The team particularly wants your thoughts about the options in Special:Preferences. The current choices in Special:Preferences are:
** {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-remember-last}},
** {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-prefer-ve}}, 
** {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-prefer-wt}}, and 
** {{int:visualeditor-preference-tabs-multi-tab}}.  (This is the current state for people already using the visual editor.  None of these options will be visible if you have disabled the visual editor in your preferences at that wiki.)  
* <mark>Can you read and type in Korean or Japanese?</mark> Language engineer [[mw:User:DChan (WMF)|David Chan]] needs people who know which tools people use to type in some languages. If you speak Japanese or Korean, you can help him test support for these languages. Please see the instructions at [[mw:VisualEditor/IME Testing#What to test|What to test]] if you can help, and report it on Phabricator ([[phab:T110654|Korean]] - [[phab:T109818|Japanese]]) or on Wikipedia ([[:ko:위키백과:시각편집기/IME|Korean]] - [[:ja:Wikipedia:ビジュアルエディター/フィードバック/IME|Japanese]]).

== 2016 WMF Strategy consultation ==

:{{int:Please-translate}}
Hello, all.

The Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) has launched a consultation to help create and prioritize WMF strategy beginning July 2016 and for the 12 to 24 months thereafter. This consultation will be open, on Meta, from 18 January to 26 February, after which the Foundation will also use these ideas to help inform its Annual Plan. (More on our timeline can be found on that Meta page.)

Your input is welcome (and greatly desired) at the Meta discussion, [[:m:2016 Strategy/Community consultation|2016 Strategy/Community consultation]].

Apologies for English, where this is posted on a non-English project. We thought it was more important to get the consultation translated as much as possible, and good headway has been made there in some languages. There is still much to do, however! We created [[:m:2016 Strategy/Translations]] to try to help coordinate what needs translation and what progress is being made. :)

If you have questions, please reach out to me on my talk page or on the strategy consultation's talk page or by email to mdennis@wikimedia.org.

I hope you'll join us! [[:m:User:Mdennis (WMF)|Maggie Dennis]] via [[Utilisateur:MediaWiki message delivery|MediaWiki message delivery]] ([[Discussion utilisateur:MediaWiki message delivery|discussion]]) 18 Nyenye 2016 à 19:06 (UTC)

== Updates to wiki search auto completion are arriving 10 March==

Hello!

{{Int:Please-translate}}. {{Int:Feedback-thanks-title}}

The [[:m:User:CKoerner (WMF)/Work/Completion Suggester beta reminder and coming soon|completion suggester beta feature]] will become the default at the first group of wikis on '''Thursday, 10 March'''. This initial rollout will start with some of the smaller wikis to ensure the change happens in an organized way. The remaining wikis will receive the update on Wednesday, 16 March. This update brings three major improvements to search. Improved search result ordering, a tolerance for a small number of spelling errors, and suggests fewer typos.

Since December 2015, 19,000 editors have already opted into the completion suggester beta feature. Contributors are encouraged to [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|try out the feature]] ahead of the release. Please share any comments on the Completion Suggester [[mw:Help:CirrusSearch/CompletionSuggester|discussion page]] in any language.

To learn more about the work of the Discovery department and other improvements to search, please check out [[wmfblog:2015/12/23/search-and-discovery-on-wikipedia/|the Wikimedia blog]].

== Server switch 2016 ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
The [[foundation:|Wikimedia Foundation]] will be testing its newest data center in Dallas.
This will make sure Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia wikis can stay online even after a disaster.
To make sure everything is working, the Wikimedia Technology department needs to conduct a planned test.  This test will show whether they can reliably switch from one data center to the other. It requires many teams to prepare for the test and to be available to fix any unexpected problems.

They will switch all traffic to the new data center on '''Tuesday, 19 April'''.<br/>
On '''Thursday, 21 April''', they will switch back to the primary data center.

Unfortunately, because of some limitations in [[mw:Manual:What is MediaWiki?|MediaWiki]], all editing must stop during those two switches.
We apologize for this disruption, and we are working to minimize it in the future.

'''You will be able to read, but not edit, all wikis for a short period of time.'''

*You will not be able to edit for approximately 15 to 30 minutes on Tuesday, 19 April and Thursday, 21 April, starting at 14:00 UTC (15:00 BST, 16:00 CEST, 10:00 EDT, 07:00 PDT).

If you try to edit or save during these times, you will see an error message.
We hope that no edits will be lost during these minutes, but we can't guarantee it.
If you see the error message, then please wait until everything is back to normal.
Then you should be able to save your edit.
But, we recommend that you make a copy of your changes first, just in case.

''Other effects'':

*Background jobs will be slower and some may be dropped.
Red links might not be updated as quickly as normal.
If you create an article that is already linked somewhere else, the link will stay red longer than usual.
Some long-running scripts will have to be stopped.
*There will be a code freeze for the week of 18 April.
No non-essential code deployments will take place.

This test was originally planned to take place on March 22.
April 19th and 21st are the new dates. 
You can [[wikitech:Switch Datacenter#Schedule for Q3 FY2015-2016 rollout|read the schedule at wikitech.wikimedia.org]].

Hello! Sorry that this is in English only, but we are using village pump messaging in order to reach as many language communities as possible. Wrong page? Please fix it [[:m:Distribution list/Global message delivery|here]].

This is an invitation to all Wikipedians: Wikimedia Deutschland has been given data space to include Wikipedia content in an upcoming mission to the Moon. (No joke!) We have launched a community discussion about how to do that, because we feel that this is for the global community of editors. Please, '''[[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia to the Moon|join the discussion on Meta-Wiki]]''' (and translate this invitation to your language community)!

Hello, after six weeks of community discussion about [https://moon.wikimedia.org Wikipedia to the Moon], there are now 10 different proposals for content for the mission. Starting today, [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikipedia_to_the_Moon/Voting|you can vote for them on Meta-Wiki]], and decide what we will work on: a Wikipedia canon, different lists, the Moon in 300 languages, an astronomy editathon, featured articles, articles about technology, endangered things, or DNA-related topics. You can even vote against community involvement. Voting is open until 24 June. Sorry that this message is again in English only, but we are using village pumps to reach as many communities as possible, so that everyone knows they can vote.

== Compact Language Links enabled in this wiki today ==

{{int:Please-translate}}
<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">

[[File:Compact-language-links-list.png|thumb|Screenshot of Compact Language Links interlanguage list]]

[[:mw:Universal_Language_Selector/Compact_Language_Links|Compact Language Links]] has been available as a beta-feature on all Wikimedia wikis since 2014. With compact language links enabled, users are shown a much shorter list of languages on the interlanguage link section of an article (see image). Based on several factors, this shorter list of languages is expected to be more relevant for them and valuable for finding similar content in a language known to them. More information about compact language links can be found in [[:mw:Universal_Language_Selector/Compact_Language_Links|the documentation]].

From today onwards, compact language links has been enabled as the default listing of interlanguage links on this wiki. Using the button at the bottom, you will be able to see a longer list of all the languages the article has been written in. The setting for this compact list can be changed by using the checkbox under ''User Preferences -> Appearance -> Languages''

The compact language links feature has been tested extensively by the Wikimedia Language team, which developed it. However, in case there are any problems or other feedback please let us know on the [[:mw:Talk:Universal_Language_Selector/Compact_Language_Links|project talk page]] or on this discussion thread. It is to be noted that on some wikis the presence of an existing older gadget that was used for a similar purpose may cause an interference for compact language list. We would like to bring this to the attention of the admins of this wiki. Full details are on [[phab:T131455|this phabricator ticket]] (in English).

Due to the large scale enablement of this feature, we have had to use [[:m:Global_message_delivery|MassMessage]] for this announcement and as a result it is only written in English. We will really appreciate if this message can be translated for other users of this wiki. Thank you. On behalf of the Wikimedia Language team: [[:mw:User:Runab_WMF|Runa Bhattacharjee (WMF)]] ([[mw:User talk:Runab_WMF|talk]]) 24 Föndo 2016 à 07:04 (UTC)

== Wikipedia to the Moon: invitation to edit ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Three weeks ago, you were invited to vote on how to take Wikipedia articles to the Moon. Community voting is over and the winning idea is to send all ‘’featured articles and lists’’ to the Moon. This decision means that, starting today, Wikipedians from all language communities are warmly invited to intensively work on their best articles and lists, and submit them to Wikipedia to the Moon. The central site to coordinate between communities will be Meta-Wiki. You will find an [[m:Wikipedia to the Moon/Working|overview and more information there]]. Hopefully, we will be able to represent as many languages as possible, to show Wikipedia’s diversity. Please feel kindly invited to edit on behalf of your community and tell us about your work on featured content!

It's quick and easy to insert a references list.
[[File:VisualEditor References List Insert Menu-en.png|alt=Screenshot showing a dropdown menu with many items|center|frameless|150px]]  

Place the cursor where you want to display the references list (usually at the bottom of the page).  Open the "{{int:visualeditor-toolbar-insert}}" menu and click the "{{int:cite-ve-dialogbutton-referenceslist-tooltip}}" icon (three books).

If you are using several groups of references, which is relatively rare, you will have the opportunity to specify the group. If you do that, then only the references that belong to the specified group will be displayed in this list of references.
Finally, click "{{int:visualeditor-dialog-action-insert}}" in the dialog to insert the {{int:cite-ve-dialogbutton-referenceslist-tooltip}}.  This list will change as you add more footnotes to the page.

You can read and help translate [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/User guide|the user guide]], which has more information about how to use the visual editor.</div></div>

Since the last newsletter, the [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor|VisualEditor Team]] has fixed many bugs. Their workboard is available [[phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]]. Their [[:mw:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are improving support for Arabic and Indic scripts, and adapting the visual editor to the needs of the Wikivoyages and Wikisources.   

=== Recent changes ===
The visual editor is now available to all users at most [[Wikivoyage:|Wikivoyages]].  It was also enabled for all contributors at the French Wikinews.

The '''[[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/Single edit tab|single edit tab]]''' feature combines the "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" and "{{int:visualeditor-ca-editsource}}" tabs into a single "{{int:vector-view-edit}}" tab.  It has been deployed to several Wikipedias, including Hungarian, Polish, English and Japanese Wikipedias, as well as to all Wikivoyages.  At these wikis, you can change your settings for this feature in the "{{int:prefs-editing}}" tab of [[Special:Preferences]]. The team is now reviewing the feedback and considering ways to improve the design before rolling it out to more people.

=== Future changes ===
The "{{int:Savearticle}}" button will say "{{int:Publishpage}}".   This will affect both the visual and wikitext editing systems.  More [[M:Editing/Publish|information is available on Meta]].

The visual editor will be offered to all editors at the remaining [[:mw:VisualEditor/Rollouts|"Phase 6" Wikipedias]] during the next few months. The developers want to know whether typing in your language feels natural in the visual editor. Please post your comments and the language(s) that you tested at [[:mw:Topic:St8y4ni42d0vr9cv|the feedback thread on mediawiki.org]]. This will affect several languages, including: [[:w:ar: |'''Arabic''']], [[:w:hi: |'''Hindi''']], [[:w:th: |'''Thai''']], [[:w:ta: |'''Tamil''']], [[:w:mr: |'''Marathi''']], [[:w:ml: |'''Malayalam''']], [[:w:ur: |'''Urdu''']], [[:w:fa: |'''Persian''']], [[:w:bn: |'''Bengali''']], [[:w:as: |'''Assamese''']], [[:w:arc: |'''Aramaic''']] and others.

The team is working with the volunteer developers who power Wikisource to provide the visual editor there, for opt-in testing right now and eventually for all users. ([[phab:T138966|T138966]]) 

The team is working on a modern wikitext editor.  It will look like the visual editor, and be able to use the citoid service and other modern tools.  This new editing system may become available as a Beta Feature on desktop devices around September 2016.  You can read about this project in a [[mediawikiwiki:Special:MyLanguage/VisualEditor/Roadmap/Update_2016-06-23|general status update on the Wikimedia mailing list]]. 

=== Let's work together ===
* Do you teach new editors how to use the visual editor? Did you help [[:mw:Citoid/Enabling Citoid on your wiki|set up the Citoid automatic reference feature for your wiki]]? Have you written or imported [[:mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:TemplateData|TemplateData]] for your most important citation templates?  <mark>Would you be willing to help new editors and small communities with the visual editor?  Please sign up for the new [[:mw:Help:VisualEditor/Community Taskforce|'''VisualEditor Community Taskforce''']].</mark>
* Learn how to improve the "automagical" [[:mw:citoid|citoid]] referencing system in the visual editor, by creating [[w:en:Zotero|Zotero]] translators for popular sources in your language!  Watch the [[Mw:Citoid/Zotero's Tech Talk|Tech Talk by Sebastian Karcher]] for more information.

== Save/Publish ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
The [[:mw:Editing|Editing]] team is planning to change the name of the [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Savearticle “<bdi>{{int:Savearticle}}</bdi>”] button to [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Publishpage “'''<bdi>{{int:Publishpage}}</bdi>'''”] and [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Publishchanges “'''<bdi>{{int:Publishchanges}}</bdi>'''”]. “<bdi>{{int:Publishpage}}</bdi>” will be used when you create a new page. “<bdi>{{int:Publishchanges}}</bdi>” will be used when you change an existing page. The names will be consistent in all editing environments.[https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T131132][https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T139033]

This change will probably happen during the week of 30 August 2016. The change will be announced in [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Tech/News|Tech News]] when it happens.

If you are fluent in a language other than English, please check the status of translations at translatewiki.net for [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Publishpage “'''<bdi>{{int:Publishpage}}</bdi>'''”] and [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Publishchanges “'''<bdi>{{int:Publishchanges}}</bdi>'''”].

The main reason for this change is to avoid confusion for new editors. Repeated user research studies with new editors have shown that some new editors believed that [https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translations&namespace=8&message=Savearticle “<bdi>{{int:Savearticle}}</bdi>”] would save a private copy of a new page in their accounts, rather than permanently publishing their changes on the web. It is important for this part of the user interface to be clear, since it is difficult to remove public information after it is published. We believe that the confusion caused by the “<bdi>{{int:Savearticle}}</bdi>” button increases the workload for experienced editors, who have to clean up the information that people unintentionally disclose, and report it to the functionaries and stewards to suppress it. Clarifying what the button does will reduce this problem.

Beyond that, the goal is to make all the wikis and languages more consistent, and some wikis made this change many years ago. The [[:m:Legal|Legal team]] at the Wikimedia Foundation supports this change. Making the edit interface easier to understand will make it easier to handle licensing and privacy questions that may arise. 

Any help pages or other basic documentation about how to edit pages will also need to be updated, on-wiki and elsewhere. On wiki pages, you can use the wikitext codes <code><nowiki>{{int:Publishpage}}</nowiki></code> and <code><nowiki>{{int:Publishchanges}}</nowiki></code> to display the new labels in the user's preferred language. For the language settings in [[Special:Preferences|your account preferences]], these wikitext codes produce “<bdi>{{int:Publishpage}}</bdi>” and “<bdi>{{int:Publishchanges}}</bdi>”.

Please share this news with community members who teach new editors and with others who may be interested.

==Wikipedia to the Moon working phase==

Dear Sango Wikipedia language community,

First of all, I am sorry to write this in English. 

You may already have heard about [[:meta:Wikipdia_to_the_Moon|Wikipedia to the Moon]]: A team of scientists called the “PT Scientists” are going to send a space craft to the moon in 2017 and they want to take Wikipedia along with them. Because Wikipedia is so big, we cannot send all of it to the moon. That is why the international Wikipedia-community has voted to send all “Featured Articles and Featured Lists“ from all languages in Wikipedia.

[[:en:Wikipedia:Featured_articles|“Featured Articles“]] is a category in many language versions of Wikipedia that collects the very best articles in that language. Your community does not currently have a „Featured Articles“ category. Ideally, we want to take every language on Wikipedia to the moon and we also want to take the best articles in your language. That is why we would like ''you'' to tell us what the very best articles in your language are.

There are two ways you could do this:

:1) You could introduce the categories “Featured Article” and “Featured List” in your language version of Wikipedia and vote for the best articles and put them in the category. We will take every article that is tagged as a “Featured Article” or a “Featured List” to the moon

:2) You could vote for the best articles in your language version of Wikipedia and put them all on one a new Wikipedia page. If you let us know where we can find that list [[:meta:Wikipedia_to_the_Moon/Working|here]], we will also take the articles to the moon.

The deadline for Wikipedia to the Moon is 31 October 2016. After that date, we will put all the Featured Articles and Lists onto a special disc and give it to the “PT Scientists.” They will take the Wikipedia articles into space next year.

We are having a problem with attackers taking over wiki accounts with privileged user rights (for example, admins, bureaucrats, oversighters, checkusers). It appears that this may be because of weak or reused passwords.

Community members are working along with members of multiple teams at the Wikimedia Foundation to address this issue.

In the meantime, we ask that everyone takes a look at the passwords they have chosen for their wiki accounts. If you know that you've chosen a weak password, or if you've chosen a password that you are using somewhere else, please change those passwords.

Select strong passwords – eight or more characters long, and containing letters, numbers, and punctuation.

== New way to edit wikitext ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

'''Summary''': There's a new opt-in Beta Feature of a [[:mw:2017 wikitext editor|wikitext mode for the visual editor]]. Please [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|go try it out]].


We in the Wikimedia Foundation's Editing department are responsible for making editing better for all our editors, new and experienced alike. We've been slowly improving [[:mw:VisualEditor|the visual editor]] based on feedback, user tests, and feature requests. However, that doesn't work for all our user needs: whether you need to edit a wikitext talk page, create a template, or fix some broken reference syntax, sometimes you need to use wikitext, and many experienced editors prefer it.

Consequently, we've planned a "wikitext mode" for the visual editor for a long time. It provides as much of the visual editor's features as possible, for those times that you need or want wikitext. It has the same user interface as the visual editor, including the same toolbar across the top with the same buttons. It provides access to the [[:mw:citoid|citoid service]] for formatting citations, integrated search options for inserting images, and the ability to add new templates in a simple dialog. Like in the visual editor, if you paste in formatted text copied from another page, then formatting (such as bolding) will automatically be converted into wikitext.

All wikis now have access to this mode as a [[:mw:Beta Features|Beta Feature]]. When enabled, it replaces your existing [[:mw:Editor|wikitext editor]] everywhere. If you don't like it, you can reverse this at any time by turning off the Beta Feature in your preferences. We don't want to surprise anyone, so it's strictly an ''opt-in-only'' Beta Feature. It won't switch on automatically for anyone, even if you have previously checked the box to "{{Int:Betafeatures-auto-enroll}}".

The new wikitext edit mode is based on the visual editor, so it requires JavaScript (as does the [[:mw:Extension:WikiEditor|current wikitext editor]]). It doesn't work with gadgets that have only been designed for the older one (and ''vice versa''), so some users will miss gadgets they find important. We're happy to [[:mw:VisualEditor/Gadgets|work with gadget authors to help them update their code to work]] with both editors. We're not planning to get rid of the current main wikitext editor on desktop in the foreseeable future. We're also not going to remove the existing ability to edit plain wikitext without JavaScript. Finally, though it should go without saying, if you prefer to continue using the current wikitext editor, then you may so do.

This is an early version, and we'd love to know what you think so we can make it better. Please leave feedback about the new mode [[:mw:2017 wikitext editor/Feedback|on the feedback page]].  You may write comments in any language.  Thank you.

== Review of initial updates on Wikimedia movement strategy process ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
''Note: Apologies for cross-posting and sending in English. [[m:Strategy/Wikimedia movement/2017/Updates/Initial announcements review|Message is available for translation on Meta-Wiki]].''

The Wikimedia movement is beginning a movement-wide strategy discussion, a process which will run throughout 2017. For 15 years, Wikimedians have worked together to build the largest free knowledge resource in human history. During this time, we've grown from a small group of editors to a diverse network of editors, developers, affiliates, readers, donors, and partners. Today, we are more than a group of websites. We are a movement rooted in values and a powerful vision: all knowledge for all people. As a movement, we have an opportunity to decide where we go from here. 

This movement strategy discussion will focus on the future of our movement: where we want to go together, and what we want to achieve. We hope to design an inclusive process that makes space for everyone: editors, community leaders, affiliates, developers, readers, donors, technology platforms, institutional partners, and people we have yet to reach. There will be multiple ways to participate including on-wiki, in private spaces, and in-person meetings. You are warmly invited to join and make your voice heard.

The immediate goal is to have a strategic direction by Wikimania 2017 to help frame a discussion on how we work together toward that strategic direction.

Regular updates are being sent to the [[mail:Wikimedia-l|Wikimedia-l mailing list]], and posted [[m:Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Updates|on Meta-Wiki]].

Dear Wikimedians/Wikipedians:

Today we are starting a broad discussion to define Wikimedia's future role in the world and develop a collaborative strategy to fulfill that role. You are warmly invited to join the conversation.

There are many ways to participate, by joining an existing conversation or starting your own: 

[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Track_A|Track A (organized groups)]]: Discussions with your affiliate, committee or other organized group (these are groups that support the Wikimedia movement). 

Track B (individual contributors): [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Cycle_1|On Meta]] or your [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Participate|local language or project wiki]].

This is the first of three conversations, and it will run between now and April 15. The purpose of cycle 1 is to discuss the future of the movement and generate major themes around potential directions. What do we want to build or achieve together over the next 15 years?

We welcome you, as we create this conversation together, and look forward to broad and diverse participation from all parts of our movement.

''Please accept our apologies for cross-posting this message. [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Updates/Start of the 2017 Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees elections|This message is available for translation on Meta-Wiki]].''
[[File:Wikimedia-logo black.svg|right|150px|link=m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017]]

On behalf of the Wikimedia Foundation Elections Committee, I am pleased to announce that self-nominations are being accepted for the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia_Foundation_elections/2017/Board_of_Trustees/Call_for_candidates|2017 Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees Elections]].

The [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees|Board of Trustees]] (Board) is the decision-making body that is ultimately responsible for the long-term sustainability of the Wikimedia Foundation, so we value wide input into its selection. More information about this role can be found [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Board of Trustees|on Meta-Wiki]]. Please read the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Board of Trustees/Call for candidates|letter from the Board of Trustees calling for candidates]].

'''The [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Board of Trustees/Candidates|candidacy submission phase]] will last from April 7 (00:00 UTC) to April 20 (23:59 UTC).'''

'''We will also be accepting questions to ask the candidates from April 7 to April 20. [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Board of Trustees/Questions|You can submit your questions on Meta-Wiki]].'''

Once the questions submission period has ended on April 20, the Elections Committee will then collate the questions for the candidates to respond to beginning on April 21.

The goal of this process is to fill the '''three community-selected seats''' on the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees. The election results will be used by the Board itself to select its new members.

The full schedule for the Board elections is as follows. All dates are '''inclusive''', that is, from the beginning of the first day (UTC) to the end of the last. 

* April 7 (00:00 UTC) – April 20 (23:59 UTC) – '''Board nominations''' 
* April 7 – April 20 – '''Board candidates questions submission period'''
* April 21 – April 30 – '''Board candidates answer questions'''
* May 1 – May 14 – '''Board voting period'''
* May 15–19 – '''Board vote checking'''
* May 20 – '''Board result announcement goal'''

In addition to the Board elections, we will also soon be holding elections for the following roles:

* '''Funds Dissemination Committee (FDC)'''
** There are five positions being filled. More information about this election will be available [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Funds Dissemination Committee|on Meta-Wiki]].

* '''Funds Dissemination Committee Ombudsperson (Ombuds)'''
** One position is being filled.  More information about this election will be available [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017/Funds Dissemination Committee Ombudsperson|on Meta-Wiki]].

Please note that this year the Board of Trustees elections will be held before the FDC and Ombuds elections. Candidates who are not elected to the Board are explicitly permitted and encouraged to submit themselves as candidates to the FDC or Ombuds positions after the results of the Board elections are announced. 

More information on this year's elections can be found [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017|on Meta-Wiki]]. Any questions related to the election can be posted on the [[m:Talk:Wikimedia Foundation elections/2017|election talk page on Meta-Wiki]], or sent to the election committee's mailing list, <tt dir="ltr" style="white-space:nowrap;font-size:12px;line-height:1.5">board-elections[[File:At sign.svg|15x15px|middle|link=|alt=(at)]]wikimedia.org</tt>.

The [[foundation:|Wikimedia Foundation]] will be testing its secondary data center in Dallas.  This will make sure that Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia wikis can stay online even after a disaster.  To make sure everything is working, the Wikimedia Technology department needs to conduct a planned test.  This test will show whether they can reliably switch from one data center to the other. It requires many teams to prepare for the test and to be available to fix any unexpected problems. 

They will switch all traffic to the secondary data center on '''Wednesday, 19 April 2017'''.
On '''Wednesday, 3 May 2017''', they will switch back to the primary data center.  

Unfortunately, because of some limitations in [[mw:Manual:What is MediaWiki?|MediaWiki]], all editing must stop during those two switches.  We apologize for this disruption, and we are working to minimize it in the future. 

'''You will be able to read, but not edit, all wikis for a short period of time.'''

*You will not be able to edit for approximately 20 to 30 minutes on Wednesday, 19 April and Wednesday, 3 May. The test will start at [https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20170419T14 14:00 UTC] (15:00 BST, 16:00 CEST, 10:00 EDT, 07:00 PDT, 23:00 JST, and in New Zealand at 02:00 NZST on Thursday 20 April and Thursday 4 May). 
*If you try to edit or save during these times, you will see an error message.  We hope that no edits will be lost during these minutes, but we can't guarantee it.  If you see the error message, then please wait until everything is back to normal.  Then you should be able to save your edit.  But, we recommend that you make a copy of your changes first, just in case.

''Other effects'':

*Background jobs will be slower and some may be dropped. Red links might not be updated as quickly as normal. If you create an article that is already linked somewhere else, the link will stay red longer than usual. Some long-running scripts will have to be stopped.
*There will be code freezes for the weeks of 17 April 2017 and 1 May 2017.  Non-essential code deployments will not happen.

This project may be postponed if necessary.  You can [[wikitech:Switch Datacenter#Schedule for 2017 switch|read the schedule at wikitech.wikimedia.org]]. Any changes will be announced in the schedule.  There will be more notifications about this.

== Wikidata description editing in the Wikipedia Android app ==

<div class="mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
[[:mw:Wikimedia_Apps/Short_descriptions|Wikidata description editing]] is a new experiment being rolled out on the Wikipedia app for Android.  While this primarily impacts Wikidata, the changes are also addressing a concern about the mobile versions of Wikipedia, so that mobile users will be able to edit directly the descriptions shown under the title of the page and in the search results.

We began by rolling out this feature several weeks ago  to a pilot group of Wikipedias (Russian, Hebrew, and Catalan), and have seen very positive [[:mw:Wikimedia_Apps/Short_descriptions/Research|results]] including numerous quality contributions in the form of new and updated descriptions, and a low rate of vandalism.

We are now ready for the next phase of rolling out this feature, which is to enable it in a few days for all Wikipedias except the top ten by usage within the app (i.e. except English, German, Italian, French, Spanish, Japanese, Dutch, Portuguese, Turkish, and Chinese). We will enable the feature for those languages instead at some point in the future, as we closely monitor user engagement with our expanded set of pilot communities.
As always, if have any concerns, please reach out to us on wiki at [[:mw:Talk:Wikimedia_Apps/Short_descriptions|the talk page for this project]] or by email at reading@wikimedia.org. Thanks!

New Page previews feature

[[:m:Special:MyLanguage/User:CKoerner (WMF)/Enable Hovercards/Phase 1|Read this message in another language]]  •  {{int:please-translate}}

Hello,

The Reading web team at the Wikimedia Foundation has been working to enable [[mw:Beta Features/Hovercards|Page previews]], [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|a beta feature]] known previously as Hovercards, as opt-in behavior for logged-in users and the default behavior for logged-out users across Wikipedia projects. Page previews provide a preview of any linked article, giving readers a quick understanding of a related article without leaving the current page. For this project, we are expecting to collect feedback over the following few weeks and tentatively enable the feature in early May, 2017.

A quick note on the implementation:

* For logged-in users who are not currently testing out the beta feature, Page previews will be off by default. Users may turn them on from [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|their user preferences]] page.
* For logged-out users, the feature will be on by default. Users may disable it at any time by selecting the setting cog available in each preview.
* For users of the Navigation popups gadget, you will not be able to turn on the Page previews feature while using navigational popups. If you would like to try out the Page preview feature, make sure to first turn Navigation popups off prior to turning Page previews on. 

You can read more about [[mw:Beta_Features/Hovercards|the feature]] and [[mw:Beta Features/Hovercards#Success Metrics and Feature Evaluation|the tests we used to evaluate performance]], try it out by enabling it from the beta features page, and leave feedback or questions [[mw:Talk:Beta_Features/Hovercards|on the talk page]].

</div></div>


Since the last newsletter, the [[:mw:VisualEditor|VisualEditor Team]] has spent most of their time supporting [[:mediawikiwiki:2017_wikitext_editor|the 2017 wikitext editor mode]] which is available inside the visual editor as a Beta Feature, and adding [[:mediawikiwiki:VisualEditor/Diffs|the new visual diff tool]]. Their workboard is available [[:phab:project/board/483/|in Phabricator]].  You can find links to the work finished each week at  [[:mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings|mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings]].   Their [[:mw:VisualEditor/Current_priorities|current priorities]] are fixing bugs, supporting the 2017 wikitext editor as a [[:mw:Beta Features|beta feature]], and improving the visual diff tool.   

=== Recent changes ===
*A '''new wikitext editing mode''' is available as a Beta Feature on desktop devices.  The [[:mw:2017 wikitext editor|2017 wikitext editor]] has the same toolbar as the visual editor and can use the citoid service and other modern tools.  Go to [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures]] to enable the {{Int:Visualeditor-preference-newwikitexteditor-label}}. 
* A new '''[[:mediawikiwiki:VisualEditor/Diffs|visual diff tool]]''' is available in VisualEditor's visual mode.  You can toggle between wikitext and visual diffs.  More features will be added to this later.  In the future, this tool may be integrated into other MediaWiki components. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T143350]
* The team have added [[:mediawikiwiki:Editing/Projects/Columns_for_references|multi-column support for lists of footnotes]]. The <code><nowiki><references /></nowiki></code> block can automatically display long lists of references in columns on wide screens.  This makes footnotes easier to read.  You can [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/maniphest/task/edit/form/1/?projects=Cite,VisualEditor,Wikimedia-Site-requests&title=Convert%20reference%20lists%20over%20to%20`responsive`%20on%20XXwiki&priority=10&parent=159895 '''request multi-column support'''] for your wiki. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T33597]
* You can now use your web browser's function to switch typing direction in the new wikitext mode. This is particularly helpful for RTL language users like Urdu or Hebrew who have to write JavaScript or CSS. You can use Command+Shift+X or Control+Shift+X to trigger this. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T153356]
* The way to switch between the visual editing mode and the wikitext editing mode is now consistent. There is a drop-down menu that shows the two options. This is now the same in desktop and mobile web editing, and inside things that embed editing, such as Flow. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T116417]
* The {{Int:visualeditor-categories-tool}} item has been moved to the top of the {{Int:visualeditor-pagemenu-tooltip}} menu (from clicking on the "hamburger" icon) for quicker access. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T74399] There is also now a "Templates used on this page" feature there. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T149009]
* You can now create <code><nowiki><chem></nowiki></code>  tags (sometimes used as <code><nowiki><ce></nowiki></code>) for chemical formulas inside the visual editor. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T153365]
* Tables can be set as collapsed or un-collapsed. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T157989]
* The {{Int:visualeditor-specialcharacter-button-tooltip}} menu now includes characters for Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics and angle quotation marks (‹› and ⟨⟩) .  The team thanks the volunteer developer, [[:S:en:User:Tpt|Tpt]]. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T108626]
* A bug caused some section edit conflicts to blank the rest of the page.  This has been fixed.  The team are sorry for the disruption. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T154217]
* There is a new keyboard shortcut for citations:  <code>Control</code>+<code>Shift</code>+<code>K</code> on a PC, or <code>Command</code>+<code>Shift</code>+<code>K</code> on a Mac.  It is based on the keyboard shortcut for making links, which is <code>Control</code>+<code>K</code> or <code>Command</code>+<code>K</code> respectively. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T99299]

=== Future changes ===
* The team is working on a syntax highlighting tool.  It will highlight matching pairs of <code><nowiki><ref></nowiki></code> tags and other types of wikitext syntax.  You will be able to turn it on and off.  It will first become available in VisualEditor's built-in wikitext mode, maybe late in 2017. [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T101246]
* The kind of button used to {{Int:Showpreview}}, {{Int:showdiff}}, and finish an edit will change in all WMF-supported wikitext editors.  The new buttons will use [[Mw:OOjs UI|OOjs UI]].  The buttons will be larger, brighter, and easier to read.  The labels will remain the same.  You can test the new button by editing a page and adding <code>&ooui=1</code> to the end of the URL, like this:  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Project:Sandbox?action=edit&ooui=1  The old appearance will no longer be possible, even with local CSS changes.  [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T162849]
* The [[:mediawikiwiki:File:Edit_toolbar_-_2.png|outdated 2006 wikitext editor]] will be removed later this year.  It is used by approximately 0.03% of active editors.  See [[:mw:Editor|a list of editing tools on mediawiki.org]] if you are uncertain which one you use.  [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T30856]

== Prototype for editing Wikidata infoboxes on Wikipedia ==

Hello,

I’m sorry for writing in English. It’d be great if someone could translate this message if necessary.

One of the most requested features for Wikidata is to enable editing of Wikidata’s data directly from Wikipedia, so the editors can continue their workflow without switching websites.

The Wikidata development team has been working on a tool to achieve this goal: '''fill and edit the Wikipedia infoboxes with information from Wikidata, directly on Wikipedia''', via the Visual Editor. 

We already [[d:Wikidata:Client editing input|asked for feedback in 2015]], and collected some interesting ideas which we [[:File:Facilitating_the_use_of_Wikidata_in_Wikimedia_projects_with_a_user-centered_design_approach.pdf|shared with you in this thesis]]. Now we would like to present to you our first prototype and collect your feedback, in order to improve and continue the development of this feature.

We present this work to you very early, so we can include your feedback before and all along the development. You are the core users of this feature, so we want to make sure that it fits your needs and editing processes.

You will find the prototype, description of the features, and a demo video, '''[[d:Special:MyLanguage/Wikidata:Client editing prototype|on this page]]'''. Feel free to add any comment or feedback on the talk page. The page is currently not translated in every languages, but you can add your contribution by helping to translate it.

Unfortunately, I won’t be able to follow all the discussions on Wikipedia, so if you want to be sure that your feedback is read, please add it on the Wikidata page, in your favorite language. Thanks for your understanding.

Thanks, [[user:Lea Lacroix (WMDE)|Lea Lacroix (WMDE)]]

It can also be turned off entirely in the user preferences. RevisionSlider has been a default feature on German, Arabic and Hebrew Wikipedia for 6 months and a beta feature on all wikis for 8 months. The feature fulfills a wish from the [[m:WMDE Technical Wishes|German Community’s Technical Wishlist]]. Thanks to everyone who tested RevisionSlider and gave valuable feedback to improve the feature!

The Wikimedia movement strategy core team and working groups have completed reviewing the more than 1800 thematic statements we received from the first discussion. They have identified [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Strategy/Wikimedia movement/2017/Cycle 2|5 themes that were consistent across all the conversations]] - each with their own set of sub-themes.

This round of discussions will take place between now and June 12th. You can discuss as many as you like; we ask you to participate in the ones that are most (or least) important to you.

Here are the five themes, each has a page on Meta-Wiki with more information about the theme and how to participate in that theme's discussion:

== New notification when a page is connected to Wikidata ==

Hello all,

''({{Int:Please-translate}})''

The Wikidata development team is about to deploy a new feature on all Wikipedias. It is a new type of notification (via Echo, the notification system you see at the top right of your wiki when you are logged in), that will inform the creator of a page, when this page is connected to a Wikidata item.

You may know that [[d:Wikidata:Main page|Wikidata]] provides a centralized system for all the interwikilinks. When a new page is created, it should be connected to the corresponding Wikidata item, by modifying this Wikidata item. With this new notification, editors creating pages will be informed when another editor connects this page to Wikidata.

[[File:Screenshot Echo Wikibase notification.png]]

This feature will be deployed on May 30th on all the Wikipedias, excepting English, French and German. This feature will be disable by default for existing editors, and enabled by default for new editors.

This is the first step of the deployments, the Wikipedias and other Wikimedia projects will follow in the next months.

If you have any question, suggestion, please let me know by pinging me. You can also follow and leave a comment [[phab:T142102|on the Phabricator ticket]].

Thanks go to [[d:user:Matěj Suchánek|Matěj Suchánek]] who developed this feature!

The next step in this transition will change the appearance of some buttons and may break some outdated (non-updated or unmaintained) user scripts and gadgets.

You can see and use the [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Project:Sandbox?action=submit&ooui=0 old] and [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Project:Sandbox?action=submit&ooui=1 new] versions now.  Most editors will only notice that some buttons are slightly larger and have different colors.

However, this change also affects some user scripts and gadgets.  Unfortunately, some of them may not work well in the new system.  <mark>If you maintain any user scripts or gadgets that are used for editing, please see '''[[:mw:Contributors/Projects/Accessible editing buttons]]''' for information on how to test and fix your scripts.

== Page Previews (Hovercards) update ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

Hello,

A quick update on the progress of enabling [[mw:Hovercards|Page Previews]] (previously named Hovercards) on this project. Page Previews provide a preview of any linked article, giving readers a quick understanding of a related article without leaving the current page. As mentioned in December we're preparing to remove the feature from Beta and make it the default behavior for logged-out users. We have recently made a large update to the code which fixes most outstanding bugs. 

Due to some issues with our instrumentation, we delayed our deployment by a few months.  We are finally ready to deploy the feature.  Page Previews will be off by default and available in the user preferences page for logged-in users the week of July 24th. The feature will be on by default for current beta users and logged-out users. If you would like to preview the feature, you can enable it as a [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|beta feature]]. For more information see [[mw:Hovercards|Page Previews]]. Questions can be left [[mw:Talk:Beta_Features/Hovercards|on the talk page]] in your preferred language. 

Thank you again.

== Improved search in deleted pages archive ==

{{int:please-translate}}

During Wikimedia Hackathon 2016, the [[mw:Wikimedia_Discovery|Discovery]] team [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T109561 worked] on one of the items on the 2015 community wishlist, namely [[m:2015_Community_Wishlist_Survey/Search#Provide_a_means_of_searching_for_deleted_pages|enabling searching the archive of deleted pages]]. This feature is now ready for production deployment, and will be enabled on all wikis, except Wikidata. 

Right now, the feature is behind a feature flag - to use it on your wiki, please go to the <code>Special:Undelete</code> page, and add <code>&fuzzy=1</code> to the URL, like this: https://test.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AUndelete&fuzzy=1. Then search for the pages you're interested in. There should be more results than before, due to using ElasticSearch indexing (via the CirrusSearch extension).

We plan to enable this improved search by default on all wikis soon (around August 1, 2017). If you have any objections to this - please raise them with the Discovery team via [http://mailto:discovery@lists.wikimedia.org email] or on this announcement's discussion page. Like most Mediawiki configuration parameters, the functionality can be configured per wiki. 
Once the improved search becomes the default, you can still access the old mode using <code>&fuzzy=0</code> in the URL, like this: https://test.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AUndelete&fuzzy=0

Please note that since Special:Undelete is an admin-only feature, this search capability is also only accessible to wiki admins.

== Discussion on synced reading lists ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
'''Discussion on synced reading lists'''

Hello,

[[File:Illustration of Reading List feature on Android Wikipedia App (not logged in).png|thumb]] The Reading Infrastructure team at the Wikimedia Foundation is developing a cross-platform reading list service for the mobile Wikipedia app. Reading lists are like bookmark folders in your web browser. They allow readers using the Wikipedia app to bookmark pages into folders to read later. This includes reading offline. Reading lists do not create or alter content in any way.  

To create Reading Lists, app users will register an account and marked pages will be tied to that account. Reading List account preferences sync between devices. You can read the same pages on different mobile platforms (tablets, phones).  This is the first time we are syncing preference data between devices in such a way. We want to hear and address concerns about privacy and data security. We also want to explain why the current watchlist system is not being adapted for this purpose. 
=== Background ===
In 2016 the Android team replaced the simple Saved Pages feature with Reading Lists. Reading Lists allow users to bookmark pages into folders and for reading offline. The intent of this feature was to allow "syncing" of these lists for users with many devices. Due to overlap with the Gather feature and related community concerns, this part was put on hold. 

The Android team has identified this lack of synching as a major area of complaint from users. They expect lists to sync. The iOS team has held off implementing Reading Lists, as syncing was seen as a "must have" for this feature. A recent [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T164990 technical RfC] has allowed these user stories and needs to be unblocked. Initially for Android, then iOS, and with web to potentially follow.

Reading lists are private, stored as part of a user's account, not as a public wiki page. There is no sharing or publishing ability for reading lists. No planned work to make these public. The target audience are people that read Wikipedia and want to bookmark and organize that content in the app. There is a potential for the feature to be available on the web in the future.

=== Why not watchlists ===

Watchlists offer similar functionality to Reading Lists. The Reading Infrastructure team evaluated watchlist infrastructure before exploring other options. In general, the needs of watchlists differ from Reading Lists in a few key ways:
* Reading lists focus on Reading articles, not the monitoring of changes.
* Watchlists are focused on monitoring changes of pages/revisions. 
** The Watchlist infrastructure is key to our contributor community for monitoring content changes manually and through the use of automated tools (bots). Because of these needs, expanding the scope of Watchlists to reading purposes will only make the project harder to maintain and add more constraints.
* By keeping the projects separate it is easier to scale resources. We can serve these two different audiences and prioritize the work accordingly. Reading Lists are, by their nature, less critical to the health of Wikipedia/MediaWiki.
* Multi-project support. Reading Lists are by design cross-wiki/project. Watchlists are tied to specific wikis. While there have been many discussion for making them cross-wiki, resolution is not in the near term.
[[mw:Wikimedia Apps/Synced Reading Lists|More information can be found on MediaWiki.org]] where feedback and ideas are welcome. 

Thank you

== presenting the project Wikipedia Cultural Diversity Observatory and asking for a vounteer in Sängö Wikipedia ==

Hello everyone,
My name is Marc Miquel and I am a researcher from Barcelona (Universitat Pompeu Fabra). While I was doing my PhD I studied whether an identity-based motivation could be important for editor participation and I analyzed content representing the editors' cultural context in 40 Wikipedia language editions. Few months later, I propose creating the '''Wikipedia Cultural Diversity Observatory''' in order to raise awareness on Wikipedia’s current state of cultural diversity, providing datasets, visualizations and statistics, and pointing out solutions to improve intercultural coverage. 

I am presenting this project to a grant and I expect that the site becomes a useful tool to help communities create more multicultural encyclopaedias and bridge the content culture gap that exists across language editions (one particular type of systemic bias). For instance, this would help spreading cultural content local to Sängö Wikipedia into the rest of Wikipedia language editions, and viceversa, make Sängö Wikipedia much more multicultural.
Here is the link of the project proposal:
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project/Wikipedia_Cultural_Diversity_Observatory_(WCDO)

I am searching for a volunteer in each language community: I still need one for the Sängö Wikipedia. If you feel like it, you can contact me at: marcmiquel *at* gmail.com I need a contact in your every community who can (1) check the quality of the cultural context article list I generate to be imported-exported to other language editions, (2) test the interface/data visualizations in their language, and (3) communicate the existance of the tool/site when ready to the language community and especially to those editors involved in projects which could use it or be aligned with it. Communicating it might not be a lot of work, but it will surely have a greater impact if done in native language! :). '''If you like the project, I'd ask you to endorse it in the page I provided.''' In any case, I will appreciate any feedback, comments,... Thanks in advance for your time!

== New print to pdf feature for mobile web readers ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
'''New print to pdf feature for mobile web readers'''

The Readers web team will be deploying a new feature this week to make it [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile_PDFs|easier to download PDF versions of articles on the mobile website]].

Providing better offline functionality was one of the highlighted areas from [[m:New_Readers/Offline|the research done by the New Readers team in Mexico, Nigeria, and India]]. The teams created a prototype for mobile PDFs which was evaluated by user research and community feedback.  The [[m:New_Readers/Offline#Concept_testing_for_mobile_web|prototype evaluation]] received positive feedback and results, so development continued.

For the initial deployment, the feature will be available to Google Chrome browsers on Android. Support for other mobile browsers to come in the future. For Chrome, the feature will use the native Android print functionality. Users can choose to download a webpage as a PDF. [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Print_Styles#Mobile_Printing|Mobile print styles]] will be used for these PDFs to ensure optimal readability for smaller screens.

The feature is available starting Wednesday, Nov 15. For more information, see [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile_PDFs|the project page on MediaWiki.org]].

== Time to bring embedded maps (‘mapframe’) to most Wikipedias ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
'''Time to bring embedded maps (‘mapframe’) to most Wikipedias'''

{{int:please-translate}}

[[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:Extension:Kartographer|Mapframe]] is a feature that enables users to easily display interactive maps right on wiki pages. Currently, most Wikipedias don’t have mapframe. But [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Maps#Milestones_and_Updates|fifteen Wikipedias]], along with all the other Wikimedia projects, are using mapframe today to display maps on thousands of pages.

A little background: over the last few months, the Foundation’s [[mw:Collaboration|Collaboration team]] has been working to improve the stability and user experience of the maps service. In addition, a question about long-term support for the maps service was recently settled, and a small team has been assigned for routine maintenance. Given these developments, bringing the benefits of mapframe to Wikipedias that lack the feature seems both safe and supportable. [[phab:T191583|Nine Wikipedias]] that use a stricter version of Flagged Revisions will not get mapframe in this release.

Maps are a valuable form of visual data that can improve readers’ understanding across a wide range of topics. If you know of any reasons why mapframe shouldn’t be implemented on your Wikipedia, let us know [[mw:Talk:Map_improvements_2018|on the project talk page]]. Unless we hear from you, we plan to release mapframe to most Wikipedias in May, 2018. So, if you foresee an issue, please let us hear from you. Otherwise, happy mapping!

Hi everyone. The [[mw:Reading/Web/Team|Readers web team]] has recently begun working on exposing issue templates on the mobile website. Currently, details about issues with page content are generally hidden on the mobile website. This leaves readers unaware of the reliability of the pages they are reading. The goal of this project is to improve awareness of particular issues within an article on the mobile web. We will do this by changing the visual styling of page issues.

So far, we have [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile Page Issues|drafted a proposal on the design and implementation]] of the project.  We were also able to run [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile Page Issues/Research Results|user testing on the proposed designs]].  The tests so far have positive results. Here is a quick summary of what we learned:
* The new treatment increases awareness of page issues among participants. This is true particularly when they are in a more evaluative/critical mode.
* Page issues make sense to readers and they understand how they work
* Readers care about page issues and consider them important
* Readers had overwhelmingly positive sentiments towards Wikipedia associated with learning about page issues
Our next step would be to start implementing these changes. We wanted to reach out to you for any concerns, thoughts, and suggestions you might have before beginning development. Please [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile Page Issues|visit the project page]] where we have more information and mockups of how this may look. Please [[mw:Talk:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile Page Issues|leave feedback on the talk page]].

== New user group for editing sitewide CSS / JS ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
''({{int:please-translate}})''

Hi all!

To improve the security of our readers and editors, permission handling for CSS/JS pages has changed. (These are pages like <code dir="ltr">MediaWiki:Common.css</code> and <code dir="ltr">MediaWiki:Vector.js</code> which contain code that is executed in the browsers of users of the site.)
A new user group, <code dir="ltr">[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Interface administrators|interface-admin]]</code>, has been created.
Starting four weeks from now, only members of this group will be able edit CSS/JS pages that they do not own (that is, any page ending with <code dir="ltr">.css</code> or <code dir="ltr">.js</code> that is either in the <code dir="ltr">MediaWiki:</code> namespace or is another user's user subpage).

You can learn more about the motivation behind the change [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Creation of separate user group for editing sitewide CSS/JS|here]].

Please add users who need to edit CSS/JS to the new group (this can be done the same way new administrators are added, by stewards or local bureaucrats).
This is a dangerous permission; a malicious user or a hacker taking over the account of a careless interface-admin can abuse it in far worse ways than admin permissions could be abused. Please only assign it to users who need it, who are trusted by the community, and who follow common basic password and computer security practices (use strong passwords, do not reuse passwords, use two-factor authentication if possible, do not install software of questionable origin on your machine, use antivirus software if that's a standard thing in your environment).

Thanks!

== Enabling a helpful feature for Template editors ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
Hello.

The team working on TemplateStyles at the Wikimedia Foundation would like to enable TemplateStyles on this wiki.

TemplateStyles is a feature to allow non-administrators to write and manage CSS styles for templates. It allows contributors who edit templates to separate content and presentation. A good web practice that makes it easier to manage the layout of templates. If you don't edit templates, this will not have any impact on your contributions. 

TemplateStyles is useful for a few reasons. 

* It makes it possible for templates to work better on mobile.
* It cuts out confusion on where to apply CSS rules.
* Editing CSS is currently limited to administrators, which is a major barrier to participation.
* All stylesheets must be loaded on all pages (whether they actually use the page or not), which wastes bandwidth and makes debugging style rules more difficult.
You can [[mw:Help:TemplateStyles|learn more about TemplateStyles on MediaWiki.org]]. [[mw:Extension:TemplateStyles|Technical documentation is also available]].

This is an optional feature and no one must use it, but template contributors are encouraged to do so! Please discuss and let us know if there are any concerns. If there are no concerns we will proceed to deploy the feature on the 9th of August.

Thank you.

== Editing of sitewide CSS/JS is only possible for interface administrators from now ==

''({{int:please-translate}})''

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Hi all,

as [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Creation of separate user group for editing sitewide CSS/JS/announcement 2|announced previously]], permission handling for CSS/JS pages has changed: only members of the <code>[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Interface administrators|interface-admin]]</code> ({{int:group-interface-admin}}) group, and a few highly privileged global groups such as stewards, can edit CSS/JS pages that they do not own (that is, any page ending with .css or .js that is either in the MediaWiki: namespace or is another user's user subpage). This is done to improve the security of readers and editors of Wikimedia projects. More information is available at [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Creation of separate user group for editing sitewide CSS/JS|Creation of separate user group for editing sitewide CSS/JS]]. If you encounter any unexpected problems, please contact me or file a bug.

Thanks!<br />

== Read-only mode for up to an hour on 12 September and 10 October ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr"><div class="plainlinks">

The [[foundation:|Wikimedia Foundation]] will be testing its secondary data centre.  This will make sure that Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia wikis can stay online even after a disaster.  To make sure everything is working, the Wikimedia Technology department needs to do a planned test. This test will show if they can reliably switch from one data centre to the other. It requires many teams to prepare for the test and to be available to fix any unexpected problems. 

They will switch all traffic to the secondary data center on '''Wednesday, 12 September 2018'''.
On '''Wednesday, 10 October 2018''', they will switch back to the primary data center.  

Unfortunately, because of some limitations in [[mw:Manual:What is MediaWiki?|MediaWiki]], all editing must stop when we switch.  We apologize for this disruption, and we are working to minimize it in the future. 

'''You will be able to read, but not edit, all wikis for a short period of time.'''

*You will not be able to edit for up to an hour on Wednesday, 12 September and Wednesday, 10 October. The test will start at [https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20170503T14 14:00 UTC] (15:00 BST, 16:00 CEST, 10:00 EDT, 07:00 PDT, 23:00 JST, and in New Zealand at 02:00 NZST on Thursday 13 September and Thursday 11 October). 
*If you try to edit or save during these times, you will see an error message.  We hope that no edits will be lost during these minutes, but we can't guarantee it.  If you see the error message, then please wait until everything is back to normal.  Then you should be able to save your edit.  But, we recommend that you make a copy of your changes first, just in case.

''Other effects'':

*Background jobs will be slower and some may be dropped. Red links might not be updated as quickly as normal. If you create an article that is already linked somewhere else, the link will stay red longer than usual. Some long-running scripts will have to be stopped.
*There will be code freezes for the weeks of 10 September 2018 and 8 October 2018.  Non-essential code deployments will not happen.

This project may be postponed if necessary.  You can [[wikitech:Switch Datacenter#Schedule for 2018 switch|read the schedule at wikitech.wikimedia.org]]. Any changes will be announced in the schedule.  There will be more notifications about this.

'''Change coming to how certain templates will appear on the mobile web'''

{{int:please-translate}}
[[File:Page_issues_-_mobile_banner_example.jpg|thumb|Example of improvements]]

Hello,

In a few weeks the Readers web team will be changing how some templates look on the mobile web site. We will make these templates more noticeable when viewing the article. We ask for your help in updating any templates that don't look correct.

What kind of templates? Specifically templates that notify readers and contributors about issues with the content of an article – the text and information in the article. Examples like [[wikidata:Q5962027|Template:Unreferenced]] or [[Wikidata:Q5619503|Template:More citations needed]]. Right now these notifications are hidden behind a link under the title of an article. We will format templates like these (mostly those that use Template:Ambox or message box templates in general) to show a short summary under the page title. You can tap on the "Learn more" link to get more information.

For template editors we have [[mw:Recommendations_for_mobile_friendly_articles_on_Wikimedia_wikis#Making_page_issues_(ambox_templates)_mobile_friendly|some recommendations on how to make templates that are mobile-friendly]] and also further [[mw:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile_Page_Issues|documentation on our work so far]].

If you have questions about formatting templates for mobile, [[mw:Talk:Reading/Web/Projects/Mobile_Page_Issues|please leave a note on the project talk page]] or [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/maniphest/task/edit/form/1/?projects=Readers-Web-Backlog file a task in Phabricator] and we will help you.

The Community Wishlist Survey. {{Int:Please-translate}}.

Hey everyone,

The Community Wishlist Survey is the process when the Wikimedia communities decide what the Wikimedia Foundation [[m:Community Tech|Community Tech]] should work on over the next year.

The Community Tech team is focused on tools for experienced Wikimedia editors. The communities have now posted a long list of technical proposals. You can vote on the proposals from now until 30 November. You can read more on the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Community Wishlist Survey 2019|wishlist survey page]].
